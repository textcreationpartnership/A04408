            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6796:3"/>vnto me, &amp; others alſo whoſe iudgmentes I fatre preferre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine owne, to be worthy the publike view. Whereupon I reſolued (though my neceſſary occaſions would ſcarce affoard me leaſure) to ſteale ſo much time from them as was neceſſary for the tranſlating it out of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish into our English tongue. More paynes and labour it coſt me then at the firſt I thought it would haue done: and I found therein that true by experience which I had often heard of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to wit, that it is not ſo eaſy to tranſlate out of one language into another, as is commonly imagined.</p>
            <p>Hauing at length finished
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6796:3"/>the ſame, I knew not to whome I might better direct it, then to You the poore afflicted Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes of this our Countrey, for whoſe comfort and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I did indeed principally from the beginning intend it. For although I do preſume it wilbe gratefull to all Chriſtians of what nation or nature ſoeuer they be, to vnderſtand of the propagation, increaſe, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in thoſe Countries where before there was neuer any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice therof, and of the conſtant perſeuerance of thoſe therein that haue ſo lately receiued and imbraced it: yet am I certainly perſwaded, that it wilbe to you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6796:4"/>much more welcome, then to any other; not only becauſe theſe moſt worthy Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Iaponia</hi> wherof this relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth entreate be of the ſame Chriſtian and Catholike Fayth and Religon that you be, and not of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuate or particular ſect or faction, of which God knoweth there is to great a multitude in the Chriſtian world in theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable dayes of ours: but alſo by reaſon of the great likeneſſe and ſimilitude betwixt their caſe and yours.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6796:4"/>well may it be ſuppoſed that it wilbe at leaſt ſome kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment vnto you (amongſt ſo many occaſions of diſcomfort as are dayly offered) to vnderſtand of the eſtate of thoſe that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges do more ſymbolize with you, then any other perſons in the world. For (omitting that they be Inhabitants of an Iland as we be, and of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Iland in thoſe partes of the world as we in theſe, of the like Climate alſo that we be, all thinges conſidered, they in a manner Antipodes to vs, and we to them) firſt of all they be but lately conuerted to the true fayth of Chriſt from Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſo be moſt of you from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6796:5"/>Schiſme or Hereſy, which is a kind of infidelity: to them it is grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted according to the ſaying S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſuffer for theyr faith; and ſo it is to you: they be falſly ſlaundered and calumniated in many thinges by the Diuels mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and ſo be you: they be perſecuted for theyr Religion, many of them to death &amp; more to loſſe of goods by the enemies of Chriſt and his holy Church; and ſo be you, very many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you hauing loſt theyr liues, and more theyr goods &amp; liuinges for no other cauſe but only the conſtant confeſſion of the Catholike Religion. Finally they for theyr valour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in Gods cauſe be famous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6796:5"/>in all thoſe partes of the world, yea, and in Europe alſo; and you for yours be no leſſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, both in all Europe, and in the reſt of the Chriſtian world: ſo that I may well ſay both of you and them, that which the Apoſtle ſayd to the Romanes (whoſe religion both they and you imbrace) <hi>fides veſtra annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatur in vniuerſo mundo,</hi> your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in fayth is published and famous throughout the whole world.</p>
            <p>Theſe then be the reaſons for which I thought it moſt expedient to dedicate this short Relation vnto You; although there wanteth not alſo another, which truly I muſt needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6796:6"/>was of great force to moue me thereunto: the which is that I hoped thereby you would both be more carefull to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in your prayers to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God the neceſſities of thoſe poore afflicted Chriſtians, your Brethren, as alſo more willing to imitate theyr admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable examples of valour and courage in the cauſe of Chriſt, and of patience and conſtancy in enduring croſſes and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, troubles and tribulations for the ſame. Many of you I know haue oftentimes occaſions miniſtred of ſuffering wronges and iniuries, loſſes and diſgraces for the ſame cauſe, the ſame Fayth and Religion for which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6796:6"/>they do endure all theſe cruell perſecutions. If then you do imitate theyr patience, theyr courage and conſtancy, theyr ioyfulnes and alacrity therein, you shall obteyne thereby the like honour &amp; renowne in earth that they haue done, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes in their company euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting crownes of glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: for as the holy Apoſtle te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyeth, <hi>Si ſocij paſſionum eſtis, eritis &amp; conſolationis;</hi> if you be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of theyr ſufferinges, yee shall alſo be companions of theyr comfortes, ioyes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations.</p>
            <p>And becauſe there be ſome things in the diſcourſe of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which proceding from an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6796:7"/>extraordinary feruour, are rather to be admired of all, then imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of any that is not after an eſpeciall manner moued by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, as we may prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iudge thoſe perſons were that did them; I doubt not but that you guided by diſcretion (reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing ſuch like actions as iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing from the particuler mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt) will apply your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, only or principally, to imitate thoſe other thinges that are more conformable to the common courſe of vertuous and pious perſons 'aſſiſted with the grace of Chriſt; knowing that thereby you shall both auoyd the domage that is incident to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6796:7"/>thoſe that rashly thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into eminent dangers; &amp; alſo gaine withall no ſmall merit to you ſoules</p>
            <p>It shall not be needfull for me to aduertiſe you how this perſecution of the poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of <hi>Iapone</hi> was partly, if not principally, occaſioned by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the ſame profeſſion in religion, as thoſe be that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you: nor yet to note how like the Diuell is vnto himſelfe in all places, cauſing the Gentiles there to hate and exterminate the pictures and images of our Bleſſed Sauiour and his Saintes, togeather with all other thinges appertayning to the promotion of Chriſtian piety, as he hath
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6796:8"/>moued your Perſecutors here vtterly to abandon and abolish them: It shall not I ſay be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me, to ſignify theſe thinges vnto you, for that I do aſſure myſelfe that your ſelues in the reading thereof will eaſily obſerue theſe and many other thinges greatly worth the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; as the great feare and care of the gentiles leaſt any reliques of the holy Martyrs should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to be reuerenced by the deuouter ſort of Chriſtians? theyr extraordinary diligence to make thoſe that were conſtant in theyr fayth, to diſſemble at leaſt a little while in the exterior profeſſion thereof: theyr falſe and ſlaunderous calumniations
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6796:8"/>of the Catholike religion: theyr feares, ſuſpitions, and iealoſies of preiſts and religious perſons concerning matters of State, all of them thinges common to them, and to the Gentils of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times that perſecuted Gods Church, as alſo to the Heritikes of all ages, and in eſpeciall to theſe of ours.</p>
            <p>That which I would wish you to reflect vpon, is only the bad ſucceſſe euen in temporall affayres which in the end befell to ſuch perſons that for worldly reſpectes, eyther forſooke theyr religion, or without care of theyr conſcience behaued themſelues to the diſcredit therof: and how on the contrary thoſe that were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6796:9"/>conſtant therein, and carefull to frame theyr liues according thereunto, beſides theyr hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines in heauen, &amp; honour vpon earth, through the Paternall prouidence of Almighty God, were euer in the end after ſome ſuffering ſufficiently prouided for.</p>
            <p>And now becauſe I do i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin that many of you hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to haue not had much notice of the Kingdome of <hi>Iapone,</hi> and leſſe of the affayres therof, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a country ſo farre diſtant &amp; remote from ours, as perhaps few or none in the world more (at leaſt, as it is acceſſible) and by reaſon thereof you will not ſo eaſily vnderſtand ſome thinges
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6796:9"/>that will occurre in the reading of this relation: I haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it not amiſſe preifly by way of a Preface or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to ſet downe ſome few things concerning the ſame that may help to giue you ſome litle light therein.

               </gap>aughty and high minded, very deſirous of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6796:12"/>honour and eſtimation. They do contemne all other Nations in the world in compariſon of themſelues, from whence proceedeth the ſmall account they make of any strangers that come into theyr country. Pouerty doth not with them diminiſh Nobility, nor Gentility nor wealth gaine or increaſe it. The better ſort do vſe great cerimonies of honour and courteſy one towardes another: yea the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people as tradeſmen and artificers muſt be vſed with reſpect, or elſe you ſhall obteyne nothing at theyr handes: neyther will they put vp intury at any man without complete reuenge. They are very carefull not to ſhew feare or cowardize in any caſe: they stand much vpon theyr grauity, and therefore they carry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues alwaies very ſoberly &amp; after a ſtayed manner: in ſo much that it is held a wondrous inciuility for any to make any great noyſe, as ſhouting, hollowing, or the like, whether it be in publike or priuate, at home or abroad. To bring vp theyr children to hardnes, as ſoone as they be new borne they waſh them in ſome riuer, and when they be weaned from the nurſe, they take
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6796:12"/>them from theyr mothers, &amp; bring them vp most commonly in exerciſe of hunting &amp; the like: when they come to a certaine age they change the forme &amp; faſhion of their apparrel, vſing therein very many cerimonies.</p>
            <p>They haue diuers faſhions very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from ours: with vs men weare hattes &amp; women euer ſomethinge on theyr heades: they both men and women go bareheaded at all times, and in all occaſions, both in the heate and could, in ſunne and wind, in haile, in ſnow and raine: they mourne in white as we do in blacke, &amp; blacke with them is worne in ſigne of ioy: we hould it good to haue white teeth, they thinke it otherwiſe, and therefore dye them black: we get on horſe blacke on the right ſide, they on the left: we when in meeting we ſalute put of our hattes, they put of theyr ſhoes. When they viſit one another, he that is viſited muſt not go out to meete the other that commeth to viſit him, nor riſe vp if he be ſet in any place, but rather contrary, if he be standing he ſittes downe to receiue him.

In ſteed of kniues and ſpoones they vſe two woodden ſtickes exceeding curiouſly, and after a farre neater faſhion then we they vſe to eate their meate. Whereas we write from one ſide of the paper to the other, they write from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In all <hi>Iapone</hi> there is but one only language, the which yet is ſo exceeding copious, and of that variety, that it may ſeeme to be many, by reaſon that for almoſt euery thinge they haue very many wordes, whereof ſome do ſignify it when mention is made thereof in contemptible manner, others when in honorable ſaſhion; ſome are to be vſed onely by the common people, others only by thoſe of Nobility or Gentry: ſome are only for men, others only for women: theyr manner of writing is very different alſo from their ſpeach; and theyr writing letters from theyr writing bookes: theyr cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6796:13"/>or letters are of a faſhion farre different from ours, and of that nature that with one only letter they ſignify ſometimes a whole word, ſometimes many words.</p>
            <p>In times paſt there was but one only King in all <hi>Iapone</hi> who was Monarch ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and obeyed and reuerenced exceedingly of all, and liued with wondrous ſtate and maieſty, and him they called the <hi>Dayri</hi> or <hi>Vo:</hi> but theſe <hi>Dayries</hi> giuing themſelues at length by occaſion of the great peace and quietneſſe they enioyed to ſloth and idlenes, and to all kind of voluptuous pleaſures and delightes, about <hi>500.</hi> yeares ago were by two principall captaines that rebelled againſt them, diſpoſſeſſed of a great part of the Kingdome, they making themſelues kinges of all they could get and maintaine by force of armes, and afterwardes others moued by theyr example did the like: ſo that within ſhort time the <hi>Dayri,</hi> although he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned with the title of vniuerſall Lord of all <hi>Iapone,</hi> yet had he ſmall or no iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction at all, only a power to giue titles of honour and dignity according vnto mens
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6796:14"/>deſires or deſertes, the which he enioyeth to thi day without any gouernement at all, ſcarce hauing meanes to maintaine himſelfe in honorable faſhion.</p>
            <p>Since thoſe times to theſe, he hath euer beene accounted King our Empe or of <hi>Iapone</hi> that could by any meanes make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe Lord of the <hi>Tenca,</hi> that is, of ſome few Kingdomes or Prouinces neere adioyning to <hi>Meaco,</hi> which is the principall Citty of all thoſe countreys, as London is in ours; and ſo in our dayes there haue beene three who haue had the name and authority of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour one after the other, not by any right or title of election or inheritance, but obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by maine force, or other wrongfull meanes. The firſt of them was called <hi>Nobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanga</hi> who conquered ſix and thirty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. The ſecond <hi>Taycoſama,</hi> or <hi>Quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacù,</hi> who being a man very meanely borne, brought vnder his dominion fifty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes or Prouinces. The third is the <hi>Xogun</hi> who re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Theſe Emperours as abſolute Lords and owners of all the country, do diſpoſe of al thinges as their pleaſure, and therefore for their owne greater ſecurity as ſoone as they haue gotten the gouerment by force or other meanes into their handes, they deuide the kingdomes or prouinces vnto diuers of their freinds, with obligation that they ſhall ſerue them in time of war with a certaine number of men, at their owne charges and expences: and theſe againe do deuide their prouinces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst their freindes with the like obligation to be ready to ſerue them in all occaſions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing to themſelues ſufficient for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their houſe and family: ſo that all the whole country doth in ſuch maner depend of the Emperour, that he giues and takes, rayſeth and pulleth downe, enricheth and impoueriſheth whome, and when, and how he pleaſeth. And it is the custom amongſt them when they take from any one their Prouince or Eſtate, or change them to another, that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6796:15"/>al the gentlemen and ſouldiers that did depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon that perſon, do leaue that prouince to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him, and either go with him, or elſe ſeeke meanes to liue in ſome other place, the trade ſemen, artificers, husbandmen, and laborers onely remaining therein.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that be the Lords or petty kinges of particular prouinces or kingdomes, as alſo all other principall perſonages, as gouernors of townes and Citties, beſides the obligation aboue mentioned, are bound at the begining of euery yere, betwixt the ninth &amp; twentith day of the firſt moone (for their acount is by Moones, and after a different manner farre from ours) to go vnto the Emperors Court to do him homage, and acknowledge their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards him, and togeather therwith they must alwaies offer him ſome thinge of good value by way of preſent, whereby he draweth to himſelfe the greatest part of all the wealth of the contry, &amp; by meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, togeather with his owne reuenews (which amount to two millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or more euery yeare) be groweth in ſhort time to be exceeding rich potent, ſtrong, and ſo powerfull that none
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6796:15"/>almost dare withstand or contradict him in any thing, no though he make himſelf a God, as diuers of them haue procured to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and esteemed.</p>
            <p>And indeed moſt of theſe that be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored amongst them as Gods, were eyther kinges famous for their valour in warre, and feates of armes, or elſe <hi>Bonzos</hi> ſingularly noted for their learning and eloquence, or ſtrict rigorous courſe of life. Theſe laſt they call <hi>Totoques,</hi> the other <hi>Camis,</hi> of whom they aske only earthly goods, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall bleſſings and benefittes, as of the <hi>Totoques</hi> they do onely the ſelicity of the future life. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall or cheife of all theſe be two, the one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Xaca,</hi> the other <hi>Amida,</hi> whome they worſhip and inuoke with great reuerence and deuotion. Their <hi>Bonzos</hi> which be thoſe that teach and preach vnto them, as our preiſtes to vs, be deuided into ten or eleuen diuers Sectes, very contrary amongst themſelues, though the moſt of them do agree in denying the prouidence of God, and immortality of the ſoule, the which they do to the end they may liue with more liberty, and more freely
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6796:16"/>giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to al kind of lewd licentiousnes. Beſides theſe Gods ſom do adore the Heauens the Sunne and Stares, others Oxen, Stags and other baſer creatures. Not farre from <hi>Meaco</hi> they haue a ſumptuous Temple dedicated to the <hi>Liſard,</hi> which they reuerence as the God of learning, wiſdome and eloquence. Many there be that do adore the Diuel who doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto them in ſundry formes and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and makes them conſidently beleeue that all thinges do depend of him, and that they proſper or haue ill ſucceſſe according to the deuotion they beare and ſhew to him.</p>
            <p>And in this miſerable blindnes was al that whole contry vntil the yeare of our Lord <hi>1549.</hi> in which the Bleſſed Father <hi>Francis Xauier,</hi> a Preiſt of the Society of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and one of the ten Companions of the holy Father <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> of happy memory who was the firſt Founder of that worthy Religious Order, did enter thereinto to preach vnto them the Goſpel of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt; the which he did vpon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>There was in a certeine port towne of <hi>Iapone</hi> called <hi>Cangoxima</hi> in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6796:16"/>of <hi>Saxuma</hi> a wealthy ſubſtantial man named <hi>Angier,</hi> who in his youth had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome enormous crime, and finding afterwardes his conſcience much burdened and tormented therewith, vſed all meanes poſſible he could inuent, or that the <hi>Bonzos</hi> could imagine to aduiſe him, to obteyne ſome remedy therefore, and procure the peace and quiet of his mind: but hauing after experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence made of all the remedies that any of the Sectes of his country could affoard, fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that his affliction did ſtill endure, he was euen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of hope of euer obteyning eaſe or remedy; vntill it happening afterwardes that the <hi>Portugalls</hi> comming with ſome ſhips vnto <hi>Cangoxima</hi> to traffique about mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, were an occaſion of rayſing a new hope in him; for he falling into familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with ſome of them, and after much other talk hauing had by theyr meanes ſome notice of Chriſtian religion, as alſo of the great Sanctity and holineſſe of life of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Francis Xauier,</hi> who at that time was famous in all the Eaſt Indies, thought with himſelfe, that perhaps by his meanes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6796:17"/>he might find ſome ſalue for the ſoare of is wounded and afflicted conſcience. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reſoluing to go and ſeeke him out, he left his houſe, wife and family, freinds kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes and country, and taking with him onely a ſeruant or two he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the <hi>Portugals,</hi> &amp; after many dangers paſt at ſea of ſtormes, tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>estes, ſoule weather, and the like, he arriued at length at <hi>Malaca,</hi> a towne of great trade and traffique in the Eaſt Indies, and there by good fortune to his great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he found the Father whom he ſought, and from thence went with him to <hi>Goa,</hi> the chiefe Citty that the <hi>Portugalls</hi> poſſeſſed in all thoſe countryes; where hauing found by following his direction as much eaſe and comfort of his mind as he did wiſh for and deſire, and being ſufficiently inſtructed in all the myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, he was baptized by him, and named <hi>Pablo de la ſanta Fe</hi> that is, <hi>Paul of the holy Faith.</hi>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6796:18"/>not farre off called <hi>Tirando</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Tigen,</hi> he withdrew his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour from them, and by inſtigation of the <hi>Bonzos</hi> made a Proclamation, that vnder payne of death none of his ſubiects ſhould leaue their former Sectes to imbrace the Chriſtian religion. Whereupon Father <hi>Xauier</hi> after he had in vaine vſed all poſſible diligence to mollify the King, and ſuffered diuers incommodities and iniuries with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding patience, taking his leaue of thoſe Christians that were already made, which amounted to the number of an hundred or there aboutes, he went vnto <hi>Tirando</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his two companions, where being now ſomewhat more expert in the <hi>Iaponian</hi> tongue then they were before, ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to preach, partly thereby and partly by the rare example of their liues, they moued more in a few dayes to imbrace the ſayth of Chriſt, and to receiue the holy Sacrament of baptiſme, then they had done in a yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at <hi>Cangoxima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>Xauier</hi> did perſwade himſelfe that if he could get vnto <hi>Meaco,</hi> which was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6796:18"/>the cheife Citty of <hi>Iapon,</hi> &amp; the place where the <hi>Cuboſama,</hi> who was then the chiefe King of all the country, did keepe his Court, that there he might do more good, and ſooner come to giue notice of Christ and his religion to the principall perſons of the Kingdome, then in any other place: and therefore hauing commended the care of the new conuerted Chriſtians in <hi>Cangoxima</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponian,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Tirando</hi> to Father <hi>Coſmo de Torres,</hi> he and brother <hi>Iohn Fernandez</hi> tooke their iourney towardes <hi>Meaco,</hi> and about the beginning of October they got vnto <hi>Amanguchi</hi> a goodly Citty at that time, for ſince it hath beene burned, ſacked, and deſtroyed, euen in the hart of all <hi>Iapone,</hi> almoſt three hundred miles diſtant from <hi>Tirando,</hi> whither being come, they were carried vnto the king or Prince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, vnto whom they declared in the beſt manner they could the principall myſteries of Christian religion, he neither ſhewing liking nor diſlike of any thing they ſayd: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes they did the like in the publike streets and market places of the Citty, wherein by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6796:19"/>reaſon they were but meanely apparreled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of religious men, and ſpake the <hi>Iaponian</hi> language but very bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenly, they were not only derided and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of all, but alſo iniured and handled very hardly by ſome of the ruder ſort. From thence they went vnto <hi>Meaco,</hi> and in their iourney which endured well nigh two monethes, they ſuffered exceeding many miſeries. Firſt they went barefoote all the way, and then becauſe the wayes were very dangerous and full of theeues who murthered all they robbed, they were enforced to keep company with horſemen, to runne though the hard ſtony wayes, as faſt as the others did ride, towade alſo ouer many great riuers and other deepe waters in the way, hauing afterwardes no meanes almost to dry, rest, or eaſe themſelues, no where finding any that would help or ſuccour them, take pitty, or compaſſion on them, but many almoſt euery where that egregiouſly abuſed and iniured them: ſo that had they not carried ſome little rice in ſachels on theyr backes for theyr ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance, it is very likely they had periſhed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6796:19"/>by the way for very want, and neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Being now arriued at <hi>Meaco,</hi> they found all the Citty in vprore and armes, no diſpoſition at all for them to manifeſt the Christian fayth: whereupon they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced almoſt immediatly to retourne againe to <hi>Amanguchi</hi> the ſame way, and after the ſame faſhion that they came from thence before. And there Father <hi>Xauier</hi> did reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, notwithstanding all difficulties, to ſet and ſettle himſelfe to the preaching and planting of religion: and becauſe he had learned by experience that the <hi>Iaponians</hi> did neyther eſteeme of men nor of theyr wordes, vnleſſe they were in exterior good faſhion, and well apparreled, therefore to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himſelfe vnto them for their greater good, he went vnto <hi>Tirando,</hi> and there at they charge of the king of <hi>Portugall</hi> he put himſelfe in good apparell, and taking with him letters of fauour fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the viceroy of the Indies, and of the Biſhop of <hi>Goa,</hi> which he had procured vnto the Princes of <hi>Iapon,</hi> and certaine ſmall thinges brought out of <hi>Europe,</hi> as clockes, and ſuch like curioſities,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6796:20"/>the which were giuen him by the Gouernor of <hi>Malaca</hi> to bestow in ſuch occaſions, he returned backe againe to <hi>Amanguchi</hi> with Brother <hi>Iohn Fernandez,</hi> and two or three <hi>Iaponians</hi> in his company, where he made meanes to haue acceſſe vnto the King to whom by way of preſent he gaue thoſe thinges which he had brought with him thither to that purpoſe. The king accepted of them willingly, and though he wondred at them as being rare and neuer ſeene before in thoſe countryes, yet much more did he admire at the greatnes of the giuers minde, who did refuſe a great quantity of gold and ſiluer, and other thinges which he offered him in requitall thereof, and only required that he would giue him licence to preach the fayth of Chriſt to whome, and where he would: the which he graunted eaſily, and aſſigned him beſides a certaine houſe of good capacity, where he and his companions might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne.</p>
            <p>This licence being thus obteyned, the which was all the holy Father did deſire, he and the Brother his Companion did ſet
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6796:20"/>themſelues immediatly to worke, preaching all the day time in the ſtreetes and middeſt of the market place, an innumerable number of people flocking about them, ſome to ſee and heare what they ſayd, others to laugh at their manner of ſpeach, others to marke their actions, and mocke at their behauiour: and in the night they did the ſame in the houſe where they lodged to thoſe that came thither to viſit them, as many did, ſome of courteſy, but moſt of curioſity. And in this manner they ſpent diuers monethes without ſeing any fruit at all of all their labours, vntill at length one was conuerted vpon this occaſion. Brother <hi>Iohn Fernandez</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching one day in the ſtreet according to his wonted manner, a <hi>Iaponian</hi> that paſſed by in a ſcornefull manner, did ſpit at him; and the filthy fleame falling iuſt vpon his face, he wiping it of, without making any ſhew of the leaſt impatience in the world, with great ſerenity of mind went forward in his ſpeach: the which being well marked and obſerued by one of the ſtanders by, cauſed him within himſelfe to frame this conceipt:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:6796:21"/>doubtleſſe this doctrine muſt needs be very good that cauſeth in the profeſſors thereof ſo great humility patience and conſtancy of mind, in ſuffering iniuries and indignities: and thereupon the Sermon being ended, he followed the brother to their houſe, where hauing learned the Creed, the ten Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, our Lords prayer, the Salutation of our B Lady, and diuers other prayers, and being ſufficiently inſtructed in all the myſteries of Chriſtian religion, and ſorry for the ſinnes of his former life, he was the first in all that Citty that did receiue the holy Sacrament of baptiſme, and thereby was made a member of Chriſts holy Church and Congregation. Soone after him diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo were baptized, and within a ſhort tyme the number of Chriſtians there amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fiue hundred or there abouts, and all of them (as they well ſhewed in many occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that happened afterwardes) exceeding conſtant, vertuous, and perſeuerant.</p>
            <p>Matters being come to this good paſſe, letters were brought vnto Father <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> in which wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Church and Chriſtiany of <hi>Iapon</hi> which now 66. years agoe was firſt founded by the Bleſſed Father <hi>Frauncis Xauier</hi> of the Society of Ieſus (and euer ſince then hath beeue principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6796:24"/>next after God by the labours and good endeauours of the Fathers of the ſame Society) hath ſuffered many great and greeuous perſecutions, euen as the Primitiue Church did in the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof. Some of theſe Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions haue been particuler only in ſome Countries or Prouinces ſubiect to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine Lordes or petty Kinges: and theſe haue beene ſo many and ſo continuall, that ſcarce euer the Chriſtians haue beene without ſome moleſtation in one part or other, as may appeare by the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of that Country written at large by Father <hi>Luis de Guzman</hi> of the Society of IESVS. Others haue been generall, cauſed by the Lords of the <hi>Tenca,</hi> who were the Monarchs of al <hi>Iapone,</hi> not only baniſhinge the Fathers of the Society, deſtroying their Churches and houſes, and taking away from them all that they had, but alſo baniſhing likewiſe the Chriſtians of the country, together with their kinred, freinds, and familiars, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcating their landes and goods, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6796:24"/>ſinally bereauing the alſo of their liues.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But neuer hitherto hath any beene eyther ſo generall, or ſo rigorous, as that which <hi>Minamoto Iyeyaſu,</hi> who at this preſent is the <hi>Xogun</hi> or <hi>Cuboſama,</hi> King and Lord of al <hi>Iapon,</hi> did raiſe now two yeares agoe in the yeare 1614. For that if heretofore the Fathers were baniſhed out of ſome one country or prouince they ſtill found refuge in ſome other part or place of the kingdome: and although <hi>Taycoſama</hi> the predeceſſor in gouerment to him that now reigneth did twiſe caſt downe and deſtroy all their Churches, and commaunded them to depart his kingdome; yet alwayes had they a Church ſtandinge on foote in <hi>Nangaſaqui</hi> (a port towne in <hi>Iapon</hi>) for the vſe of the Portugall merchants who traffique thither; and vnder colour of that, they not onely remained there, but alſo from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce went ſecretly into many other prouinces of the kingdome, and did great good amongſt the Chriſtians; who likewiſe were neuer before vſed ſo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6796:25"/>hardly as at this time they be. For that the <hi>Xogun</hi> in this perſecution hath not onely cauſed all the Churches to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and razed to the ground, and giuen expreſſe charge that no Prieſt nor prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Chriſtian religion whether he be a ſtranger or free-denizen ſhould remaine therein, but alſo hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that all the Chriſtians do leaue their faith and religion vnder paine of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the kingdom, or being put after many torments to ſome cruel kind of death Vpon this occaſion there haue happened many accidents worthy of memory, to the great honor and glory of Almighty God, and very like to thoſe of the primitiue Church, as in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this Relation wil appeare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The cauſes and reaſons of this ſo rigorous ſentence and proceeding of the <hi>Xogun,</hi> and of the execution thereof, be diuers, ſome of old, and ſome of new. Of old is the hatred of the Diuell, who hauing had peaceable poſſeſſion more then a 1000. yeares of al that kingdome,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6796:25"/>and ſeing that now of late by reaſon of the preaching, teaching, holy life and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Fathers, many thouſands of ſoules were daily drawne from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and ſuperſtition to the knowledge and ſeruice of the true and euerliuing God, their onely Lord, maker, creator, and redeemer, and that very probably within ſmal time if they were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he ſhould be altogether diſpoſſeſſed of the tyrannical dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſo long exerciſed vpon them, did therefore al his endeauours to hinder their proſperous proceedings; eſpecially for that already (beſides many thouſandes that were departed this world) there were then liuing more then two hundred and fifty thouſand Chriſtians, ſo zealous &amp; feruo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the ſeruice of their Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, that beſides their diligence to learne and know all the duties of good Chriſtians, and their care in keeping &amp; obſeruing gods precepts and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, many of them did animate themſelues to attaine to a higher perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6796:26"/>and to follow the Euangelicall Counſailes of Virginity, Chaſtity, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary pouerty, recollection and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This I ſay made him beſtir him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and moue the <hi>Bonzos</hi> his Miniſters, to hate the Fathers bitterly, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their diſgrace by al means poſſible: the which was not very had to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe themſelues did ſee that their credits with the people was much decreaſed ſince their comming into the country, as alſo their gaines greatly diminiſhed. For which cauſe within ſhort time after the entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Fathers, to auert the minds of the people from them, they publiſhed that they were Diuels in humane ſhape ſent from hell to hinder the happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the <hi>Iaponian</hi> Sectes; that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes whereſoeuer they entred went preſently to wracke; that they did eate mans fleſh, and the like. But all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes being found out in ſhort time to be wholy falſe and vntrue, reproachfull ſlaunders, and forged calumniations,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6796:26"/>they changed their note and begun ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tune, proteſting in their Sermons that it ought not to be endured, that a few poore ſtraungers (as the Fathers were) ſhould be permitted to procure with ſo great diligence &amp; endeauour as they did, the deſtruction of their Idols, Temples and Sectes, that had beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſo highely eſteemed of all their anceſtours; and to bringe into their country another new law and religion, and cuſtomes wholy oppoſite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto thoſe which ſo long time had beene profeſſed and practiſed therein: complayning moreouer, that thoſe that were made Chriſtians in many thinges were more obedient vnto the Fathers then vnto their owne Princes &amp; naturall Lordes, and that for their religion they would by their perſwaſion looſe both their liuinges, honors, and their liues. Moreouer they ſayd, that it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, nor poſſible, but that the Fathers vnder colour of preaching the religion and faith of Chriſt, had ſome pretence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6796:27"/>of matter of ſtate: nor that any wiſe man could perſwade himſelfe, that men of iudgment and diſcretion (as the Fathers ſeemed to them to be) would euer come from ſo far countries, with ſo great coſt and charges, through ſo many and ſo euident perills and dangers, both by ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. And to giue a greater colour of likelyhood and ſhew of reaſon for what they did affirme, they added thereunto diuers thinges which were moſt true, as that the Spaniardes (of which Nation moſt of the Fathers be) be very warlike people, and how they haue conquered the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> the <hi>Ilandes</hi> of <hi>Molucas,</hi> and the <hi>Philippines;</hi> that all the Chriſtians conuerted by the Fathers are

For although he were moued thereunto principally by reaſon of the deſire he had to haue taken the great Spaniſh galeon, called <hi>S. Philip,</hi> which paſſed by that way vnto <hi>Noua Eſpana</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:6796:28"/>from the <hi>Philipines;</hi> yet was he alſo not a little prouoked by the fooliſh wordes of a certaine Pilot, who being asked how the Spaniardes had gained ſo many king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, he anſwered that they went firſt to traffique into them, and that if therein they eyther receyued iniury of any, or were not wel vſed, or not receiued by the people of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, that then they made warre againſt them, and ouercomming them, tooke poſſeſſion of their kingdom and eſtats. And being asked if they did not alſo for that cauſe ſend religious men before them, he anſwered, yes: the which although it were moſt falſe and fabulous, yet did <hi>Taycoſama</hi> take it as a ſufficient occaſion to rayſe a cruell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt al the Chriſtians of <hi>Iapone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. This ſuſpition was confirmed in them, yea &amp; much increaſed by certeine <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who in the time of this <hi>Xogun</hi> do not onely traffique but alſo ſome of them reſide and dwel within <hi>Iapone:</hi> for they partly through
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6796:28"/>the hare they haue and beare to religious men and Catholikes, and partly for feare leaſt the Spaniardes ſhould be a meanes to hinder their traffique thither, haue made many malicious and moſt vile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes, euen the very worſt they could imagine or inuent, both of the one and other. As for example that the religious men are dangerous perſons, both wicked and rebellious: that they do not preach Chriſts true Religion, but onely their owne fancies &amp; imaginations, and that for that cauſe they haue beene oft times baniſhed by Chriſtian princes in <hi>Europe</hi> out of their kingdomes and dominions; that the Spaniardes haue no other end nor intention in comming thither, but onely to bereaue them of their kingdom and gouerment, alledging to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and as it were in proofe thereof many particuler examples to make ſome ſhew of truth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That they were the authors of theſe falſe reportes, came to be knowne from the <hi>Xogun</hi> himſelfe, who one day in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6796:29"/>ſpeach vſed theſe wordes: That if the Kinges and Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> do baniſh the Fathers out of their countries, I ſhall do them no iniury to ſend them out of mine. Theſe and ſuch like malitious ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and reportes were in themſelues ſufficient to haue beene cauſes of greater harmes and miſcheifes then they were for a longe time, had not Almighty God in a maner bound and held the Gentiles handes, who with the deſire of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge traffique with the <hi>Spaniardes</hi> and <hi>Portugalls,</hi> eyther would not heare, or when they heard would neuer giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit vnto ſuch wicked and malitious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Diuell perceiuing this, and knowinge well how that by occaſion of the traffique from the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Macan,</hi> Chriſtian religion found firſt entrance into <hi>Iapone,</hi> and how by meanes thereof it hath hitherto alſo beene there conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that if it ſhould ceaſe, religion could not probably be of longe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance there, he did therefore his vtmoſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6796:29"/>endeauour to hinder it, and for that cauſe it is moſt likely, that firſt of all he moued the Heretikes to go thither, to the end that by their falſe reportes they might bring into diſcredit with the Gentiles the Catholike religion: and offer to bring them the ſame merchandiſe that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes</hi> and <hi>Portugals</hi> haue done hitherto. Secondly, that the <hi>Xogun,</hi> through the falſe informations of a Gouernor called <hi>Safioyedono,</hi> and other his adherentes ſhould moſt iniuſtly commaund that the ſhip of traffique of <hi>Macan</hi> ſhould be ſet vpon, and taken moſt iniuriouſly, the which in the yeare 1610. by that occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſet on fire and burnt to the domage of diuers Chriſtians, and little leſſe in all then a million of loſſe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And finally that ſome <hi>Iaponians</hi> did wrongfully take and vſurpe at the ſame time, almoſt all the goodes of the ſhip called <hi>S.

                  <hi>Portugals</hi> as were ſcarce to be endured: and matters came thereby to that paſſe, that it was thought it would haue been an occaſion of the total ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all the Chriſtianity of <hi>Iapone,</hi> had it not pleaſed Almighty God by the good endeauours, diligence and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ſome freinds, and eſpecially of <hi>Don Iohn Arimadono,</hi> who at that time was in great fauour with the <hi>Xogun,</hi> to haue pacified matters, and ſo calmed the tempeſt that was then riſing againſt them.</p>

               <p>DON <hi>Iohn Arimadono</hi> aforeſaid was Lord and Prince of all the Prouince of <hi>Arima.</hi> He was an Auncient Chriſtian, a great benefactor, and as it were the very prop and piller of the whole Church of <hi>Iapone,</hi> as well for that he had cauſed the conuerſion of all his ſubiectes to the Chriſtian faith, by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6796:30"/>meanes of the Fathers of the Society, whome he alwaies fauored very much, not onely permitting them to preach freely to all in his dominions, but alſo giuing them ſuccour &amp; harbour therein euen in the time of the greateſt fury of <hi>Taycoſama</hi> his perſecution, expoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thereby to the danger of looſing his honour, eſtate, and life, and that not once but oftentimes, although he were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much moleſted both by ſome freinds of his owne, as alſo by the Lords of the <hi>Tenca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There was cloſe by his country of <hi>Arima</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>other Prouince which indeed of right belonged vnto him, and had beene ſometime poſſeſſed by his ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but now was vſurped by another man. This prouince <hi>Don Iohn</hi> did much deſire to obtaine by meanes and fauour of the <hi>Xogun,</hi> &amp; to that end he vſed ſome meanes not ſo conformable either to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or to the law of God as might haue beene wiſhed and deſired. One was to marry his ſonne &amp; heire, who was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:6796:31"/>married to another wife, vnto a yong lady that was grandchild to the <hi>Xogun.</hi> Another was in hauing a hand by the appointment of the <hi>Xogun</hi> in the burning of the ſhip of <hi>Macan,</hi> whereof we ſpake before, vnder pretence of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine iniuries done vnto ſome <hi>Iaponians,</hi> it being indeed nothing ſo, but onely a deuiſe and deceit of <hi>Safioyedono.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſeemed vnto him that by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the people of that prouince which he pretended Chriſtians, by deſtroying Idolatry in it, and building Churches to God therein, that theſe ſinnes which he committed, to condeſcend with the <hi>Xogun</hi> &amp; get his fauor, would be therby wel ſatisfied, and the ſcandal giuen vnto the Chriſtians eyther wholy taken away or elſe much qualefied: but it happened much otherwiſe (and indeed thinges though they be good and holy, if they be brought to paſſe and compaſſed by euill meanes, can haue no good end, and commonly haue bad ſucceſſe.) For firſt of all Almighty God permitted him to be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6796:31"/>deluded by a falſe fellow, a counterfait and feigned Chriſtian called <hi>Dayfachy Paulo,</hi> who receauing of him many bribs both for himſelfe and for other fauorites of the <hi>Xogun,</hi> did perſuade him that the <hi>Xogun</hi> had made him a graunt of that Prouince, and that the Letters patentes therof were already drawne, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it was found out all to be a meere coſenage and decept. Wherupon <hi>Dayfachy</hi> was put in priſon for it, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced of Forgery, was condemned to death, and finally burned for falſifiyng the Kinges Letters. Then <hi>Don Iohn</hi> his owne ſonne called <hi>Saiemon Noſuque,</hi> by the perſwaſion of his new maried wife the grand child of the <hi>Xogun,</hi> and alſo carried away with ambition and deſire of comaund, ioyning and vniting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with ſome of his Fathers mortall enemies, made ſuch complaintes? and framed ſuch articles againſt him vpon this occaſion, that they cauſed-him to be baniſhed by the <hi>Xogun,</hi> and his eſtate to be aſſigned to his ſonne. And finally by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6796:32"/>procurement of his owne ſayd ſonne, &amp; his wife whom he had cauſed to marry againſt all right and reaſon, hoping by her meanes more eaſily to compaſſe his deſires, to honor and ſtreng then his houſe and family: by their meanes, I ſay, and others, who feared leaſt comming to anſwere for himſelfe he would diſcouer their falſe dealinges, and accuſations layd againſt him, he was at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of his life. And in this ended the vnlawfull and euill grounded worldly pollicy of <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> although he dyed very penitent for that he had done, with great ſignes of true ſorrow and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his ſinnes, and of good prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for his death, forgiuing al iniuries had beene offered him, and asking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all whome he had offended. And in him the whole new planted Church of all <hi>Iapone</hi> did looſe exceeding much, for he, as I ſaid before, was a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, ſupporter, and a ſtay thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By reaſon of the bad procedings of <hi>Don Iohn</hi> in the thinges aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6796:32"/>and his euill ſucceſſe therein, the Gentills tooke occaſion to ſpeake their pleaſure of the Catholike religion, and to calumniate it as though the ſinnes and imperfections of ſome particuler perſons that profeſſe it, were to be imputed to their faith, it being in it ſelfe moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, pure, and holy. The <hi>Xogun</hi> alſo thereupon begun the perſecution of the Chriſtians of the Prouince of <hi>Arima,</hi> who were all <hi>Don Iohn</hi> his ſubiectes, and moſt louing towards him. For being as he was euen from the very begining of his gouerment ſo great an enemy to Chriſtian religion, that he commanded that none of his houſe ſhould be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans vnder paine of looſing both their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges and their liues, proteſting publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely that all the princes of <hi>Iapone</hi> ſhould do the like with their ſubiectes, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreating <hi>Don Iohn</hi> oftentimes that he would renounce his religion, as being vnworthy to be profeſſed of ſo principall a perſon as he was, and that he would permit Temples to be built to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6796:33"/>the Idols in his Countryes; vpon this occaſion of the baniſhment of <hi>Don Iohn</hi> he ſent word vnto his ſome <hi>Sayemon Noſuque,</hi> that ſeing he did him the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to place him in his Fathers eſtate and gouernement, as alſo to admit him to marry with his owne Grandchild, that in recompence thereof he would haue him leaue to be a Chriſtian, and not only himſelfe, but all his ſeruantes and ſubiectes alſo, and that he ſhould baniſh the Fathers out of his Countryes. And for the execution thereof he ſent vnto him for his director and chiefe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayler in the buſineſſe <hi>Safioye</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor of <hi>Nangaſaqui</hi> a great enemy to Chriſtians. <hi>Sayemon</hi> durſt do no other then obey him in all he commaunded, for feare of looſing his eſtate, and ſo hereupon immediatly through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle of his new <hi>Herodias,</hi> his pretended wife, and the policies of <hi>Safioyedono,</hi> he begunne the perſecution of <hi>Arima,</hi> and of that was occaſioned afterwardes the generall perſecution in all <hi>Iapon,</hi> as after
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6796:33"/>ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Xogun</hi> moreouer did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund enquiry to be made amongſt his owne Seruantes, Souldiers, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, to ſee if any of them were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and hauing found that fourteene of them were ſo, all of them perſons of note and quality, and fiue or ſix of them noble, rich, and his great faubrites, he was exceedingly offended therewith: and hauing vnderſtood that after dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence vſed with them, there was no meanes to make them change their mindes, he baniſhed them all togeather with their wiues and families, in ſuch rigorous manner, that he commaunded all the Princes of <hi>Iapone</hi> vnder greiuous paynes and puniſhmentes, that none ſhould giue them any ſuccour or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Great was the courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy which theſe good Chriſtians ſhewed in this extremity in looſing their landes &amp; liuinges for our Sauiours ſake, rather then they would leaue his holy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6796:34"/>fayth whereof they made profeſſion, being ready alſo to looſe their liues for the ſame cauſe, if occaſion had beene offered. They ſuffered exceeding much, themſelues, their wiues, and children wandring vp and downe, and going ſecretly here and there, not finding any place where to abide. <hi>Iulia</hi> alſo a principall Lady of the Court who was baniſhed for the ſame cauſe to a little Iland ſcarce inhabited, did ſuffer there exceeding much in this occaſion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Many noble perſonages in the Courtes of <hi>Yendo</hi> and <hi>Suruga</hi> did imitate the <hi>Xoguns</hi> proceedinges in this kind, but aboue all the Prince of <hi>Toxogun</hi> did ſhew himſelfe moſt cruell and rigorous, moued partly by the <hi>Xoguns</hi> example, but principally incited by the wordes of an Engliſh Pilot who ſpake moſt bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt religious men and Spaniardes, making their perſons odious vnto him, and all that they did ſuſpitious. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many Chriſtians of great worth &amp; quality were ſent into baniſhment. And
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6796:34"/>this affliction had beene much more greeuous and more generall, had not <hi>Itacuradono</hi> the Gouernor of <hi>Meaco,</hi> an honorable, moderate and morall man, &amp; a friend vnto the Fathers, ſignified vnto the <hi>Xogun,</hi> that it was no reaſon that all the Chriſtians, being as they are, people that liue in the Kingdome well and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, and do hurt and iniury to none, ſhould be puniſhed for the fault of ſome one, or a few particuler perſons of their Religion: neyther do I hold it (ſayd he) for good policy, now that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is in peace and quietnes, to ſtrike a ſtring that may make to great a noyſe, &amp; perhaps put matters more out of tune, then is by vs imagined.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Vpon this good aduiſe the <hi>Xogun</hi> did for a while ſomewhat temper him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and gaue licenſe againe that the Fathers of the Society might remaine, and haue one Church within the Citty of <hi>Meaco:</hi> and thereupon, and by reaſon that the Gouernour did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime that the <hi>Xoguns</hi> former order was
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6796:35"/>not to be vnderſtood of merchantes, tradeſmen, or common people, but only of Souldiers and Gentlemen, many of their Churches did remaine vntouched, and the Chriſtians in ſome good quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for that many other Princes winked at them, as at the Fathers alſo. So that this perſecution firſt of all begunne as it ſee meth in <hi>Suruga</hi> and <hi>Yendo,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the principall blow did fal vpon the prouince of <hi>Taccacu,</hi> or <hi>Arima,</hi> which is all one.</p>

And ſinally that, that flocke of Chriſt whereof they had had ſo great care, ſhould be now deliuered to the cuſtody of cruell wolues the <hi>Bonzos,</hi> without hauing any Paſtor that might feed it, keepe it, and defend it. Like good ſheepheardes therefore they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to animate their ſheep, and arme them by meanes of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, which they miniſtred vnto them, making alſo many ſpirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations vnto them and pyous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, perſwading them therein to patience, conſtancy and perſeuerance, to faſting, prayer, and true penance for their ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. As ſoone as <hi>Arimadono</hi> was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at <hi>Ximauara</hi> which is the firſt towne of that Prouince, together with <hi>Saſiove</hi> and another fauourite of the <hi>Xogun,</hi> who
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:6796:36"/>were his wicked counſaylers, which was vpon the ninth of Iuly, they publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed an edict or Proclamation, in which was commaunded that all his ſubiectes and ſeruantes ſhould leaue the faith of Chriſt, and ſend for the <hi>Bonzos</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the ſectes of <hi>Iapone,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing withal three Iudges vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they gaue order to procure by all meanes poſſible, that all the Gentlemen of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that had any rentes, reuenewes or penſions from the <hi>Xogun,</hi> ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly Ieaue to be Chriſtians vnder paine of looſing both them, and the reſt of their goods and liuinges, and thereby be reduced to extreme pouerty and moſt miſerable eſtate. And vpon the 13. day of the ſame moneth he ſent word vnto the Fathers of the Society, that ſeeing the <hi>Xogun</hi> had forbidden the profeſſion of Chriſtian religion, his pleaſure was they ſhould immediatly depart out of his Country, leauing their Churches and houſes as they ſtood. The ornaments of the Church, the pictures, and their bokes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6796:36"/>they had cauſed before to be conuaied to <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> and ſo they diſpatched now the ſooner obeying to his commaund, though not without great greife and affliction, for they had in that country a Colledge the beſt and biggeſt in all <hi>Iapone,</hi> a Seminary alſo where they did bring vp many yong youthes and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Iaponians,</hi> teaching them le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arning and vertue, latin, muſicke, and the characters of the Religions and ſectes of <hi>Iapone,</hi> and the manner how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them, which hath beene one of the beſt and moſt efficacious meanes for the conuerſion of thoſe Gentiles. They had alſo in that Country of <hi>Arima</hi> ſix other places of ordinary reſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, beſids other Churches and houſes, which now and then they viſited to the number of three ſcore and ten: and all theſe in one day were confiſcated, and they caſt out of them. Some of the Fathers remayned in the contry ſecretly &amp; diſguiſed, together with ſome of the Brothers alſo &amp; youths of the Seminary, for the better helping
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:6796:37"/>of the poore afflicted Chriſtians thereof. And although they did it not without great labour and paines, and exceeding danger of their liues; yet was it wel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed with the great good they did thereby among the Chriſtians, who with great care, loue, and charity did hide them, keep them, and maintaine them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The Iudges appointed by young <hi>Arimadono</hi> for the examining and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt the Chriſtians, ſent for ſome of them one after another, and did their beſt endeauors to perſwade them to do ſome exterior act whereby at leaſt they might make ſhew to haue obeyed to the <hi>Xoguns</hi> commaund in leauing of their faith. Some although very few did eaſily condeſcend to their requeſts, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge thereby to gaine the fauour of their Prince; and theſe all of them were ſuch as eyther were not well grounded in their faith, or elſe were men of euil life, and bad corrupted conſciences.

But being afterwards aduiſed of their fault, and told how great a ſinne it was, they were ſo ſeriouſly ſorrowful and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent therefore, and did recompenſe their fall with ſo great courage, ſeruour and conſtancy, that ſome of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards endured moſt cruel martyrdome, and others ſuffered incredible afflictions want, miſery, and pouerty for their faith after they had publikely reuoked that which before they had of frailty done: and this they did before the Iudges, and <hi>Arimadono</hi> himſelfe, asking pardon of all for the offence and ſcandall they had committed through feare, and in a manner vnawares. All the reſt anſwered

               <p>ARIMADONO fearing he might diſguſt the <hi>Xogun,</hi> and ſo perhaps looſe his Eſtate, if he did ſhew himſelfe remiſſe in perſecuting the Chriſtians (although on the other ſide he ſaw the courage they ſhewed) commaunded vpon the twentith day of Iune, that the landes and goodes of fiue rich Gentlemen ſhould be confiſcated, and that they, their wiues, children, and families ſhould be put out of their houſes, taking no other thinge with them, but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:6796:39"/>only the apparrell on their backes: char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging withall that none ſhould intertaine them in their houſes, nor giue them any food, reliefe, or ſuſtenance vnder payne of ſeuere and grieuous puniſhment. He cauſed moreouer officers to be ſet in the high wayes, port townes, and paſſages to the end they ſhould not eſcape out of his country, but periſh there for hunger, want, and miſery, euen in they eyes of their deareſt friendes and kinsfolkes. Much they ſuffered by this meanes for liuers dayes, liuing only vpon hearbes and ſuch wild fruites as they found gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing in the woodes, being perpetually expoſed to the cold, the wind and raine which at that time happened to be very much, vntill at length the Chriſtians of <hi>Arima,</hi> and other places found meanes to help and ſuccour them, and by the order and direction of one of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they made themſelues little cabbins of ſtraw, among the mountaines for their aboad, therein ſpending their time in faſting, prayer, and reading of good
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6796:40"/>and holy bookes, and ſo they led their liues a great while, not only with great patience, but with much ioy alſo, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and content.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Arimadono</hi> perceiuing by this that what hitherto he had done againſt the Chriſtians did little or nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, he reſolued with himſelfe to put to death ſome of them, to wit, ſuch as had ſhewed themſelues more forward and feruorous: by which meanes the happy lot of martyrdome befelvnto two brethren the one called <hi>Michael Soday</hi> of fifty yeares old or therabouts, the other <hi>Matthias Coychi</hi> of one and thirty. They were both of them borne in a towne of that Prouince called <hi>Ariye,</hi> their parentes were perſons of good quality and very worthy Chriſtians. <hi>Michael</hi> was alwayes accounted very deuout &amp; feruorous, &amp; from his very childhood he was of ſo great vertue, purity and integrity, that none euer noted in him any thing that might be a mortall ſinne. He was but weake and ſickly, by reaſon of the hard
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:6796:40"/>vſage of his body with faſting, hayre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, diſciplines, and other penances. All his delight was in hearing ſermons, and reading good and pious bookes, in ſomuch that he ſeemed rather a religious man then ſecular. He was very chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and deſirous alwayes to help others all he could, for which cauſe he was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally beloued of all, and reſpected and eſteemed as a father. By the appointment of the Fathers of the Society he had for the ſpace of fifteene yeares the care and direction of thirteene Congregations or Confraternities into which the deuouter ſort of Chriſtians for their excerciſe of vertue had put and placed themſelues. And in this imployment did his brother <hi>Matthias</hi> help him, being as like vnto him in good qualities and vertuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, as he was in bloud and natural condition. When the Fathers were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from <hi>Arima</hi> (as before is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) <hi>Michael</hi> called togeather all the Prefectes and Officers of the thirteene Congregations, and told them that the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:6796:41"/>time was now come in which they muſt all ſhew their faith; and the deſire they had of the ſaluation of their ſoules: Let euery one therefore (ſayd he) as ke thoſe of his Confraternity what diſpoſition and courage they feele and find within themſelues. Whereupon amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they made a catalogue or role, in which within ſhort time more then fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred with great ſpirit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution did write their names in ſight that they were ready &amp; prepared to giue their liues and ſuffer al kind of torments, rather then leaue and forſake the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Michael,</hi> and his brother were the two firſt whoſe names were written in the Catalogue, and he ſayd, he did deſire it ſhould be ſo, becauſe he hoped by that meanes he might animate others to do the like. And the reaſon why he wiſhed the reſt would imitate him and his brother therein, was to the end, that if the Iudges ſhould offer any more to call the Chriſtians to examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <p n="4">4. Vpon the Eue of <hi>S.

In the afternoone, which was vpon the day of the glorious Saint <hi>S.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:6796:43"/>which the Father that day had vſed in the holy Sacrifice of the maſſe, and carrying him aſide, they gaue him three or foure woundes, with which he fell downe and dyed, ſaying with a loud voyce, <hi>Ieſus, Maria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The executioner that cut of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaels</hi> head did great reuerence to their two holy bodyes, and taking ſome of their holy reliques, he gaue notice to the Chriſtians of their death and cauſe thereof. So many came thither to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence theyr bodies, and to get ſome of their reliques, that they could ſcarce get them burried all that night: at length they buried them, though afterwardes they were taken vp againe and carried to the Church of <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> where they were likewiſe much reuerenced of all, ſome taking peeces of their apparrell ſome parcels of their hayre, others ſome of their bloud: many therewith made the ſigne of the croſſe on their own fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heades deſiring much to imitate and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them in dying for their fayth. An
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:6796:43"/>old man of threeſcore and ten yeares called <hi>Ioachim,</hi> as ſoone as he had notice of their death, went running to the place where their bodies lay, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Matthias</hi> his body by the ſeete, he moſt earneſtly deſired the executioners who yet remayned there, that they would do the like to him, ſeing he alſo was a Chriſtian, and had promiſed <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> to dye in his company.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some monethes before this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happened, <hi>Lucy</hi> the mother to theſe two holy martivs, a very deuout and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Chriſtian, did ſee in a viſion a moſt beautifull child, who hauing two pretious ſtones in his handes, ſhewed them vnto her, and ſhe deſiring to take them in her handes, he vaniſhed away. The next day following he did appeare againe with two noſegayes made of many goodly followers, and when ſhe deſired to haue taken them as before, he vaniſhed away againe: likewiſe the third day he appeared againe with two beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull red roſes in his handes, at which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:6796:44"/>ſhe wondring, told her ſonne <hi>Michael</hi> of it, and he afterwardes related it to another brother of his who is of the Society: not long after ſhe dyed, and as ſeemes that Almighty God thereby would let her vnderſtand how gratefull and beautifull the ſoules of her two ſonnes were in his heauenly eyes.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſame ſentence of death was executed vpon <hi>Leon Quita Quinzaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> on the two and twenty day of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 1612. He was a Gentleman of a good houſe, and a very valerous ſouldier of fifty yeares of age or thereaboutes he was borne at a towne called <hi>Chinxina,</hi> and from his youth very vertuous and of exemplar life. When <hi>Arimadono</hi> came firſt to <hi>Ximauara, Leon</hi> ſent him word that if he meant to make vſe of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, it could not be but vpon condition that he would giue him leaue to liue a Chriſtian, for that otherwiſe he would not ſerue him. He went vp and downe two monethes and more without his ſword, expecting an anſwere from
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:6796:44"/>
                  <hi>Arimadono,</hi> animating with great feruor all to conſtancy, and to that end viſiting the neighbour townes and villages. And ſome wondring to ſee him go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ſword, he told them: <hi>Seing that I am not to defend myſelfe when they come to kill me for Chriſtes cauſe, I haue no need at all to weare my weapon.</hi> Going vp and downe in this manner he, found that the Chriſtians of one towne durſt not bury publikely one that was dead; and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending them for their cowardize there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they told him they feared ſome hurt and domage would befall him for the great boldneſſe which he ſhewed. To which he anſwered: <hi>What can they do to me more then kill me, and for that I am very ready whenſoeuer they will, for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I more deſire then to dy for Chriſt:</hi> and ſaying ſo, with his owne handes he buryed the dead body of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Iudges did procure by all meanes poſſible to perſwade him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himſelfe vnto the time, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:6796:45"/>ſo he might enioy his liuing and be in fauour with his Prince: and a certaine Noble man that loued him very well, called <hi>Camon,</hi> who was Vncle to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madono,</hi> after diuers perſwaſions ſayd vnto him: What matter is it man, if our Prince will go to hell, let vs make no moreado but go with him thither too. To whom he anſwered: <hi>My Lord the obligation which the ſeruant hath to his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and the ſubiect to his Prince doth end togeather with this life, for in the next life they haue no power nor authority at all: and if your Lordſhippe will not beleeue me make try all if you pleaſe, and call any of thoſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines that haue dyed in your ſeruice, or in the ſeruice of your anceſtor, and ſee if they do now anſwere to your call. In ſuch thinges therefore that doe concerne this preſent life, I will very willingly ſerue my Prince, but in thoſe that do pertaine vnto the next and whereon my ſaluation doth depend, he must pardon me, I cannot nor I will not do it.</hi> And vnto a brotherinlaw of <hi>Arimadono</hi> that did intreate him concerning the ſame
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6796:45"/>matter he anſwered: <hi>Although I confeſſe it will be ſomething a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffu ult vnto me to ſerue now one that hath left to be a Chriſtian, I hauing before ſerued in the warre two ſo good Chriſtian Princes, as were Don Iohn and his brother Don Stephen, yet notwithſtanding obtaine you that I may liue freely in my reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and I will do willingly that which you deſire me.</hi> In many other occaſions like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſufficiently ſhewed his great zeal and feruor which for breuines ſake I do not heere rehearſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In concluſion <hi>Arimadono,</hi> becauſe with his example and ſpeaches he did much animate the reſt, gaue commaund vnto two ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſouldiers that they ſhould kil him ſecretly, for the reaſon before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. They therefore ſent for him one day vnto the caſtle, and he imagining the cauſe to be that which indeed it was, went thither with great alacrity; and the ſouldiers going out to meet him, asked him whither he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? He a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered that he went to the Caſtle called by the Prince: wherfor ſaid they? to haue my head out of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:6796:46"/>ſayd he, becauſe I will not leaue to be a Chriſtian: and in this manner they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t talking with him, and he wiſhed them they would haue care to looke to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of their ſoules, all other buſineſſes whatſoeuer in compariſon thereof being of ſmall account and conſequence. He made the ſigne of the Croſſe vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe many times as he went alonge the way, &amp; comming to a place where there had beene a Church of the Society, he kneeled downe vpon the ground, and prayed for a while: which done he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vp and going forward in the way one of the ſouldiers with his ſword gaue him ſo great a blow vpon one of his ſhoulders, that he cut him downe into the breſt: he then pronouncing the holy name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> three times aloud, vnbuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled his rapier, and caſting it away from him did his endeauour to bleſſe himſelfe with making the ſigne of the Croſſe, and ſo fell downe and dyed. The Chriſtians came thither preſently, and becauſe the ſentence that <hi>Arimadono</hi> had giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:6796:46"/>him was publikely knowne, as alſo the cauſe thereof, togeather with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and preparation he made for martyrdome, they therefore tooke his holy body, and ſent it ſecretly to the houſe of the Society of Ieſus in <hi>Nanga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaqui,</hi> where it was buryed with all due reſpect and reuerence.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The happy deathes of the three foreſayd martyrs cauſed ſo great feruour and courage in all the Chriſtians of that Country and Eſtate, that now they did not thinke nor talke of any other thing, but onely how to prepare themſelues to imitate and follow them: to that end by the counſaile and aduiſe of one of the Society, they began in the Citty of <hi>Arima</hi> to renew their Confraternities, not admitting into them any one, but onely ſuch as were fully reſolued to giue their liues, and all they had, yea and to ſuffer all kind of tormentes rather then to deny the faith of Chriſt. They made amongſt themſelues certaine lawes and rules, and ſet downe the faſtes, the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6796:47"/>and other pennanes they were to do. Then they did deuide themſelues into <hi>Decuria's</hi> (Companies of ten) to the end that meeting ſo in diuers places they might the better help one another. And the like was done by the Chriſtians in al the townes of that whole country of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> with a kind of holy emulation: but before any one could be admitted into any Confraternity, they did many pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and other thinges of piety to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues thereto. The like was done by the women, and by the children alſo; the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinking that in matters of deuotion they ought not to be inferior vnto men, and the children deſiring and endeauoring to imitate theyr parentes piety.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And this was the preparation which the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people made, although they were not comprehended in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation: and we may with reaſon thinke that, that which the gentlemen and other of better ſort did make, was not inferior vnto this, Thoſe who, as I
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:6796:47"/>ſayd before, at the entreaty and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of their freindes had in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning exteriourly condeſcended to do ſome thinges not ſo conuenient, being now exceeding ſory and repentant for their fault, deſired no other thinge ſo much, as ſome good occaſion wherein publikely to acknowledge their error, &amp; to make profeſſion of their faith. For which cauſes it being a cuſtome among the <hi>Bonzos</hi> in their feſtiual dayes, in ſigne that one is of their ſect, to take a booke made by <hi>Xaca,</hi> which is called <hi>Foque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quio,</hi> and to put it vpon the heads of their pariſhioners or ſectaries, ſaying ther with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a certaine prayer: and one of them hauing in treated <hi>Arimadono</hi> that vpon a certaine ſolemne day, he and his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers would do this ceremony, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired amongſt themſelues not onely not to do it, but alſo to diſgrace the <hi>Bonzo</hi> if he did perſiſt therein. The day appointed came, but notice being had of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, and both <hi>Arimadono,</hi> and the <hi>Bonzo</hi> being afrayd, that if the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:6796:48"/>were done, it would redound more to their diſgrace and to the encorageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Chriſtians, they thought it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more conuenient to omit the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and ſo it was done, <hi>Arimadono</hi> himſelfe alone going to viſit the <hi>Bonzo</hi> without any more ado. Wherewith the Gentlemen were not a little grieued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had loſt that good occaſion of publiſhing their mindes, which yet they determined to manifeſt, and did that very day, going all together vnto the Iudges, vnto whom they ſpake in this manner: <hi>We be all Chriſtians, and are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deſirous to ſuffer baniſhment, and death rather then for ſake our fayth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: and ſeeing that we haue not had meanes to ſignify ſo much to Arimadono in publike, we deſire you to do it for vs.</hi> So many they were that went thither with that proteſtation, that although <hi>Arimadono</hi> were ſo much offended therewith that he commaunded they ſhould be all put to death, yet could it not be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, vnleſſe he would haue left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

One among the reſt named <hi>Leon</hi> hauing ſhewed himſelfe ſo conſtant that he was condemned to death therefore by <hi>Arimadono's</hi> ſpeciall order, becauſe he vnderſtood that a friend of his thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to doe him a pleaſure had counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayted his hande, and going to the Iudges therewith, aſſured them therby that he had reuolted from his fayth, he tooke foure witneſſes with him &amp; went vnto the Iudges, telling them he was a Chriſtian, and that the ſubſcription which had beene ſhewed vnto them as his, was not his, but counterfayte and falſe. The Iudges hauing heard him gaue order he ſhould be ſent immediatly into baniſhment. His wife thinking that for this action of her huſband both he and ſhe ſhould haue beene put to death, put on the beſt apparell ſhe had, expecting therein the ſentence and execution: but as ſoone as ſhe vnderſtood that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:6796:49"/>of death was changed into ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, leauing of her gay attire, and her husband laying aſide his weapons, &amp; looſing all his wealth, they departed from their houſe in poore apparell, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to looſe and leaue much more then they had done, for our Bleſſed Sauiours ſake.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Arimadono</hi> at the beginning of the firſt moneth of the yeare 1613 went vnto the Court according to the cuſtome of <hi>Iapone</hi> to viſit the <hi>Xogun</hi> for that new yeare, and being on the way his Iudges wrote vnto him of the great feruor of the Chriſtians, and how that euery day ſome came before them to make poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their fayth: and therefore they deſired him he would conſider what they ought to do therein. He anſwered that for a warning and example to the reſt they ſhould thruſt out of <hi>Arima Don Iohn Tacry n,</hi> who was his owne great Vncle, a graue and aged Gentlemen of great eſteeme, and a father to the Chriſtians, taking from him the greateſt part of his
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6796:49"/>reuenewes. And that they ſhould depriue <hi>George Tefengi</hi> (who was a very worthy Chriſtian, and had beene a famous Captaine about <hi>Meaco,</hi> and baniſhed alſo from the kingdome of <hi>Fingo,</hi> &amp; loſt his caſtle for his conſcienceſake) of al his liuing, &amp; baniſh him out of the country of <hi>Arima,</hi> &amp; finally that they ſhould put to death <hi>Thomas Onda Feibioye</hi> togeather with his brother mother and children.</p>
               <p n="14">14. This <hi>Thomas</hi> was he that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Iudges ſo reſolutly as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the end of the precedent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and <hi>Arimadono</hi> becauſe he was a man of notable courage and valour had giuen him once leaue to liue a Chriſtian, but not many monethes afterward he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun againe to intreate and vrge him very much that he would accommodate himſelfe vnto the time, aſſuring him that therein he ſhould giue him great content: Whereto he anſwered, that neyther in honeſty nor Chriſtianity he could, nor would ſhew himſelfe diſloyall vnto God: but yet for all that he ſtill
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6796:50"/>perſiſted, vrging him euen till a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure towardes the Court, and was much grieued to ſee he could not preuaile againſt his conſtant reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the which Thomas wel perceyuing, grew more carefull of himſelfe: and to be in better diſpoſition for whatſoeuer might ſucceed, he made a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all his life vnto the Father that went ſecretly and diſguiſed amongſt them, of whome alwayes when he came to his houſe to celebrate the holy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the maſſe, he receiued the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes with particuler deuotion: and all his diſcourſe with him commonly was what a happy thing it was to giue ones life for the loue of God. He vſually did much pennance, and gaue himſelfe to prayer, grieuing oftentimes that he had loſt ſo many good occaſions to dye for Chriſtes holy fayth, and true religion.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Vpon the 21. of Ianuary one of <hi>Arimadono</hi> his Gouernors ſent for him to his houſe, and another of them ſent for his brother <hi>Matthias,</hi> and there ſecretly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:6796:50"/>they cauſed them to be ſlayne, cutting of both their heades, they calling at that time vpon our Bleſſed Sauiour with great deuotion and content, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their ſoules into his holy handes. <hi>Thomas</hi> was one and forty yeares old when he was put to death, and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Matthias</hi> was one and thirty, both of them very well beloued of all ſortes of people, for their good nature and rare qualities but much more for their vertu and Chriſtianity. The Iudges ſent word forthwith vnto their mother <hi>Martha</hi> of the death of her two ſomes, ſignifying withall that ſhe and her grandchildren muſt beare them company. The which newes although to ſome it might ſeeme heauy, yet did ſhe receiue it with ſignes of great ioy and contentment, and as though it had beene a meſſage ſent from heauen vnto her: and giuing thankes to Almighty God, &amp; to thoſe that brought it her, ſhe ſent immediatly for her two grandchildren whoſe names were <hi>Iuſtus</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> the one of eleuen, the other of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:6796:51"/>nine yeares old. Their mother <hi>Iuſta</hi> was pardoned her life at the intreaty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of ſome of her kinsfolkes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe nothing at all deſired it, it being to her worſe then death not to dy in that occaſion.</p>
               <p n="16">16. When her children tooke their laſt leaue of her, they ſpake theſe wordes vnto her: <hi>God be with you deare Mother, for we be ſent for to accompany our Father vnto heauen; both he and we will expect you there.</hi> She kiſſing and bleſſing them, gaue them great charge they ſhould not be afraid of death, nor ſhew any ſigne of feare or cowardize at all. Then ſhe and her good mother-in-law took their leaue of one another with many teares, ech giuing the other good counſaile and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe: which being done, the two little children with their good grand-mother were carried to a place by the ſea ſide which was appointed for their executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; whither being come, <hi>Iames</hi> the yonger of the two remembring the good counſaile that his mother had giuen him, did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:6796:51"/>vncouer his owne necke and layd downe his little head vpon the blocke in readines for the hangman to cut it of, &amp; then deuoutly ſaying <hi>Ieſus Maria</hi> three ſeuerall times the Executioner bereaued him of his life. His brother <hi>Iuſtus</hi> with like conſtancy and more then manly fortitude did follow him. Then their holy Grandmother <hi>Martha</hi> a graue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone of three ſcore yeares and one, and the example of al that country of <hi>Arima,</hi> glad to haue ſeene the Sacrifice of her ſonnes and grandchildren for ſo good a cauſe, deteyned her ſelfe a good while in her prayers, and then giuing to ſome preſent certaine holy reliques which ſhe had about her, and to others her beades which ſhe wore about her necke, and ſome part alſo of her apparrell, ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them al very earneſtly to pray for her to Almighty God, and ſo falling againe to her prayers ſhe had her head cut of by the ſame executioner that before had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed her two grandchildren. Her head together with her bloud was carefully

                  <hi>SAFIOYE,</hi> ſeeing that with his violent manner of proceeding, putting ſome to death and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, he was ſo far from obteyning
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:6796:52"/>of his purpoſe and deſire, that rather matters were worſe now then they were before: for thoſe that were but ſomwhat bold before, were now much more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the examples they had ſeen, and with the hope of victory &amp; heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reward, and thoſe that had ſhewed ſome weaknes &amp; frailty at the firſt, by the ſame examples were moued to be very ſory and repentant for their fall, and roſe vp againe with couragious reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he now determined to change his rigour into another kind of crafty cunning perſecution. He ſought out therefore a certaine <hi>Bonzo,</hi> an auncient preacher of the <hi>Iaponian</hi> Sectes, that was very famous in the Courtes of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruga</hi> and <hi>Yendo,</hi> and brought him to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimadono,</hi> telling him that if he could get the Chriſtianes of his country to heare his Sermons, without all doubt they would very quickly little eſteeme, wholy giue ouer, and leane the Chriſtian Fayth. He wiſhed him therefore to carry him to <hi>Arima</hi> with him, and to make
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:6796:53"/>him preach therein. <hi>Arimadono</hi> to giue content vnto <hi>Safioyedono</hi> and the <hi>Xogun,</hi> was very willing therewithall, and <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zui</hi> (for ſo was the <hi>Bonzo</hi> his name) was not backward but rather exceeding glad to go, thinking doubtleſſe he ſhould do ſome great exploite and gaine immortall Fame in conuincing and conuerting of the Chriſtians: the <hi>Bonzos</hi> of <hi>Mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. Aſſoone as the Chriſtianes of <hi>Arima</hi> had intelligence of the <hi>Bonzo</hi> his comming towards them, they begane forthwith to prepare themſelues: And ſent vnto the Biſhop and vnto Father Prouinciall of the Society, to know of them what they might do, neyther to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice their Conſciences, nor to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their duty to their Prince. And it was reſolued that they ſhould neyther go out to meet the <hi>Bonzo,</hi> nor afterwards
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:6796:53"/>to viſit him. The which although ſome of them did not obſerue, going at the petition of the chiefe Gouernour to viſit him, yet when they went they carried their beades in their handes, and <hi>Agnus Deies</hi> at their neckes, in ſigne that they were Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was appointed by <hi>Arimadono</hi> that there ſhould be a Temple or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and an Altar made for the <hi>Bonzo</hi> his vſe: and becauſe the Chriſtians neyther for loue nor money, neyther by threats nor intreaties could be brought to put their hands thereunto, they were forced to fetch from other places Carpenters &amp; other workmen who were Gentills, for the framing &amp; making thereof. When the Temple was finiſhed and all in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, <hi>Banzui</hi> would needs now haue them come to heare him preach. Some went of curioſity to heare what he would ſay, but before the end of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon they did ſo laugh, ſo mocke and deride him both in the Temple and after in the ſtreets, that the poore <hi>Bonzo</hi> almoſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6796:54"/>beſides himſelfe did grieuouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine to <hi>Safioye,</hi> that inſteed of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him as he expected they had brought him thither, as it ſeemed, wholy do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace him, and make him looſe his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: Telling him withall, that if <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dono</hi> would ſhew ſome exemplar puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon ſome of the principall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the reſt would be terrified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Whereupon the matter was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>Arimadono,</hi> and by him, and them it was determined, that eight or ten of them ſhould be put to death pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blikely, together with their wiues and Children.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Great was the feruour that was at that tyme amonge the Chriſtians, continuall their prayer and frequent their doing of pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nances. In many places they made the prayer of Forty houres continually without intermiſſion, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully following the counſailes, direction and exhortation of the Fathers of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that in diſguiſed habits liued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. Innumerable daily entred
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:6796:54"/>into the Confraternities, writing their names in the Cataloges, euen with their owne bloud which to that end they let out of their bodies, and making prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, that aſſiſted by the grace of God, they would remaine firme and conſtant in the confeſſion of their Faith. As ſoone as it was knowne that ſome of them ſhould be put tormentes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to death, a wondrous great ioy aroſe amongſt them all, ech one congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating the good newes with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, freinds, and kinred; euery one alſo deſirning that it might be his happy lot to be one of thoſe that ſhould dy for the Chriſtian Cauſe in that occaſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Out of all the townes of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try there was ſix or ſeauen of euery Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity ſent to the Citty of <hi>Arima</hi> to giue Intelligence when, and where the ſentence ſhould be put in Execution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, with intention all of them to be preſent there to make publike proteſtation of their faith, and to ſhew how deſirous they were to dy therefore.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:6796:55"/>And this was in ſuch manner that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt al tradſmen and artificers did leaue their worke and occupations, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes did ſuſpend their traffique vntil they ſaw what would be the yſſue and concluſion thereof.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But <hi>Safioye</hi> hauing vnderſtood of all that paſſed amongſt them, fearing ſome vprore, and doubting that he ſhould be blamed for it at the Court: ſeeing alſo that their reſolution was ſuch, that to vſe rigor towards them, ſhould be but to caſt oyle into the fier, rather augment their conſtancy then otherwiſe, he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded no more ſhould be done in that buſines: and thereupon the Chriſtians returned all vnto their houſes with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention there to prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt another tyme for Martyrdome. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this command of <hi>Safioye, Banzui</hi> the <hi>Bonzo</hi> at the petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dono</hi> his wife, who was an eager enemie vnto the Chriſtians, would needes vrge ſome Gentlewomen and pages that way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the pallace, to take of him certaine
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:6796:55"/>ſcroles and graines which the <hi>Bonzos</hi> vſe to giue, and which they call <hi>Iuzus,</hi> and <hi>Maburi;</hi> but it was his misfortune and hard hap to gaine as little honor in this matter as he had done before by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; for ſome of the yonger ſort vpon that occaſion not only refuſed to take his <hi>Iuzus</hi> with deuotion, but alſo made him and them an obiect of their myrth; and ſome of them being to much vrged by him in that buſines caſt his trumperio in his face, for which he did reueng him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe euen to the full, cauſing ſome of of them to be put in priſon for it, and others to be baniſhed.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A little after this, there came newes from the Court, that by occaſion of a little Chappell that was built by the Chriſtians, for certaine poore leprous perſons of <hi>Yendo,</hi> the <hi>Xogun</hi> was ſo much offended therewith, that after many examinations and other diligences vſed he comanded and cauſed 28. of them to be put to death at three ſeuerall tymes, they all ſuffering moſt conſtantly ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:6796:56"/>a Martyrdome becauſe they would not deny the Fayth of Chriſt. Eight of them were put to death vpon the 16. day of Auguſt, and fourteene vpon the 17. the reſt in the next moneth follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Moreouer he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that all the Chriſtians, whoſe names were written downe in the Catalogue (whereof vpon ſome other occaſion perhaps heereafter we may ſpeake) ſhould be compelled to leaue their fayth. This newes made great impreſſion in <hi>Safioyedono,</hi> and thereupon he tooke occaſion to cauſe the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of thoſe whereof I purpoſe now to ſpeake to be put to execution <hi>Safioyedono</hi> when he departed from <hi>Nangaſaqui</hi> vnto the Court at <hi>Suruga,</hi> ſent word to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madono,</hi> that it was reported in the Court that he was a Chriſtian, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did not only not endeauour that his ſubiects ſhould be otherwiſe, but rather procured that the faith of Chriſt ſhould daily floriſh more and more in his dominions: and that doubtleſſe the <hi>Xogun</hi> now at his going to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:6796:56"/>the Court would aske him how the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtood, and that he muſt needs certify the truth although much againſt his wil, which being knowne, it ſeemed to him very likely that he would be ſharply rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for permtting matters to be in that manner that they were. He wiſhed him therefor as a freind to conſider wel what he did, by reaſon he perceaued that his Eſtate vpon this reſpect was in great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and ieopardy.</p>
               <p n="8">8. With this meſſage <hi>Arimadono</hi> was at his wits end and almoſt beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſeeing that it ſeemed to him he had already done almoſt all he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtians, and for that cauſe had depriued himſelfe, by putting ſome to death and ſending others into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the beſt, moſt faithfull and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſeruants of his houſe. And thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with himſelfe that he ſhould be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vndone, if <hi>Safioye</hi> did make ſuch a Relation to the <hi>Xogun</hi> of him as he ſayd he would, he publickly proteſted, that he had now no Chriſtians in his houſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:6796:57"/>and that he therfore wondred very much any ſuch reportes ſhould be made of him. When he made this proteſtation he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that none would haue contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that which he had ſayd, and ſo ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhould ſufficiently haue complyed with <hi>Safioye.</hi> But ſome that thinking perhapps, that they had obligation in that occaſion to manifeſt themſelues, anſwered him aloud and ſayd; yea, and if it pleaſe your Excellency there be ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y Chriſtians in your houſe and thoſe alſo that are very deſirous to ſpend their bloud for their fayth and religion: and there withall eight Gentlemen of the beſt note and quality in al <hi>Arima</hi> did manifeſt themſelues for Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Arimadono</hi> was now much more greeued and afflicted then before, and cauſed <hi>Safioye</hi> his letter to be ſhewed them, deſiring them for the loue they bare vnto him, that they would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelues vnto the tyme. They anſwered him with couragious reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in no caſe, and for no reſpect
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:6796:57"/>they could condeſcend to his requeſt therein. The day following which was vpon the firſt of October he called them all vnto him, one by one and very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, teares accompaning his wordes, ſpake vnto them in this manner. My eſtate and honor wholy ſtandeth at this preſent in your handes for as you cannot chooſe but know I haue many enemies who by this meanes do ſeeke my vtter ouerthrowe. For the loue therefore that you beare me, I beſeech you make but only ſome kind of ſhew before the <hi>Bonzo</hi> for one day, nay but for one houres ſpace that you be no Chriſtians, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards do euen as you pleaſe. To the reſt of the Chriſtians you ſhall do a great good turne in doing ſo, for I with this will reſt ſatiffied and trouble no one man more, and if you do it not I ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to proceed with rigor againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. And although perhaps it be a ſinne, you are not ignorant that <hi>S. Peter</hi> being an Apoſtle, yea the Chiefe of them all, denied Chriſt, and yet afterwards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:6796:58"/>pardon for it: much more may you who do not deny him in your hartes nor yet for feare, but only make a ſhew to deny him, and that for a very little tyme, to conſerue thereby a whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince and the Chriſtians therof in peace and quietnes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. With theſe reaſons and the like, fiue of the eight did yeald themſelues vnto his will, and afterwardes he gaue aſſault vnto the other three, reducing to their memory the many benefits they had receaued of his houſe and family: he told them he meant to do them more, and that it was no reaſon for a thing that might ſo eaſily be remedied to put in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his honor and eſtate. But they anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered him with ſuch couragious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, grounded vpon ſolide and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall reaſons, that being out of hope to bring them to his becke, he went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to <hi>Nangaſaqui</hi> to take his leaue of <hi>Safioye,</hi> to tell him what he had done, and take his further aduiſe what afterwardes to do.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:6796:58"/>11. The three glorious Confeſſors of Chriſt returned very ioyfully home, confeſſed themſelues immediatly with one of the Society, and procured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelues for martyrdome which now it ſeemed they were almoſt aſſured of. And vpon the fifth day of October came the ſentence from <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> that they their wiues and Children ſhould be burned aliue. The ſame day in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone it was notified vnto them, and a certaine houſe appointed them for their priſon, vnto the which they went moſt willingly without any officer or other perſon to carry or conduct them thither. The names of thoſe that went in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner were theſe, <hi>Adrian Tacafati Mondo</hi> and <hi>Ioanna</hi> his wife, <hi>Leon Fayaxida Lugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyemon</hi> and his wife <hi>Martha,</hi> with two children, <hi>Iames</hi> of eleauen yeares of age and <hi>Magdalen</hi> of eighteene, a very ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous virgin, who with the licence of her ghoſtly Father and good liking of her parentes had made a vow of her virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſome yeares before, <hi>Leon Taquendomi
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:6796:59"/>Canyemon,</hi> and <hi>Paul Canyemon</hi> his ſonne.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And togeather with theſe did two other valorous ſouldiers of Chriſt enter into the priſon to beare them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in dying for their fayth, although afterwards they were put out from thence with no ſmall griefe vnto their hartes, becauſe their names were not in the Catalogue. Only there was wanting <hi>Monica</hi> the wife of <hi>Leon Taquendomi,</hi> with a daughter of hers of nyne yeares old. The reaſon of their abſence was, becauſe it was reported credibly to her that the women ſhould not be put to death, whereupon ſhe and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not without many teares had before taken their leaues of her husband and ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, and they of them: but afterwardes <hi>Leon</hi> vnderſtanding the truth, he vſed meanes to giue her notice thereof, which when ſhe knew, preſently leauing her houſe, her goodes, and all ſhe had, ſhe came with her daughter running after him, but ſhe was ſtayed in the way, and caried by force vnto the houſe of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:6796:59"/>Gentleman Vncle vnto <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dono,</hi> who becauſe he had brought her vp of a child, would needes ſaue her and her daughter from the fyer. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were both of them much afflicted therewith, and vſed many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, that they might be ſent vnto the priſon with the reſt, yet could they not by any meanes obteine it. For which cauſe <hi>Monica</hi> that night leaped ouer a wall and ſo got out of the houſe to go vnto the priſon, but being found by the watch, ſhe was hindred &amp; caried backe againe.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Of thoſe fiue which yealded to the intreaty of <hi>Arimadono,</hi> as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, foure of them falling ſoone after into conſideration with themſelues, were exceeding ſory for their fault, and vſed all meanes poſſible to amend the ſame.

                  </gap>entes and goodes they had, the which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6796:60"/>they gaue vnto the Gouernors, ſaying that they from their childhood had been Chriſtians, and how being ſeduced by the intreatres of their Lord, they had ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed frailty only for one day, for the which they were exceeding ſorrowfull, and did repent themſelues, and ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering vnto them their goodes, they went vnto the priſon, and would haue entred in, but were not permitted by the Officers. Agreeing therefore among themſelues they went all togeather into a houſe thereby, and from thence they wrote a letter to the <hi>Bonzo Banzui,</hi> in which they did proteſt how they were Chriſtians, and did deſire to dye for Chriſt, and that the frailty they had ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed proceeded of deceipt, and that they were very ſory for it. <hi>Arimadono</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from <hi>Nangaſaqui</hi> &amp; hauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their repentance, commanded they ſhould be ſet free, and that they might liue Chriſtians. But they with wondrous griefe and ſorrow not to haue obteyned their deſire, cauſing their head
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6796:60"/>to be al ſhauen, in token that they meant to forſake the world, leauing theire houſes, goodes, and liuinges, did volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily baniſh themſelues, to expect ſome other where a better occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuffer for their fayth.</p>
               <p n="14">14. As ſoone as the ſentence was knowne and publiſhed that the three a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue named with their wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be burned, there was ſo great a concourſe of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to ſee that ſpectacle from all the townes and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages therabout, that all the wayes and ſtreets were filled with men and women of all ages, ſortes, and qualities: and which is worthy to be noted amongſt them all, they being more then twenty thouſand in number, there was not ſo much as one only ſword or other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon whatſoeuer, it being an vſual thing there for almoſt euery one to go with his weapons; but inſteed thereof euery one had their roſary or beades in their hands to pray vpon, and nothing els; and many of them came in ſuch haſt, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6796:61"/>their very meate, leauing alſo their houſes open, and not one to keepe them or looke vnto them. <hi>Banzui</hi> the <hi>Bonzo</hi> for very feare retired himſelfe into the caſtle, and a certaine diſciple of his went in all haſt to <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that the Chriſtians were vp in rebellion, and that they had killed his Maiſter. <hi>Safioye</hi> was much troubled with this newes, but the Gouernors did aſſure him that there was none there that had any Armes, and that they did not ſo much as offer to make the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in the world. In ſo much that it being told them, that <hi>Arimadono</hi> had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded they ſhould be driuen from thence with muſket ſhot, there was not one that fled, or ſtirred, but with great ſilence and deuotion there they ſtood all that night praying on their beades, which euery one held in his handes, ſetting forth ſo many lights in euery place, that the citty of <hi>Arima</hi> ſeemed to be another ſtarry firmament.</p>
               <p n="15">15. So great was the ioy of the holy
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:6796:61"/>priſoners and the thankes they gaue vnto Almighty God to ſee themſelues in that eſtate, that they could ſcarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine themſelues through the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they felt. That night they ſpent all in prayer, diſciplining themſelues alſo all of them togeather. It was imagined moſt conuenient by ſome in authority, that they ſhould be put to death ſecretly, and their bodies to be hidden, partly for feare ſome violence would be offered by the Chriſtians, and partly becauſe their Reliques ſhould not be reuerenced. But the Prefectes or Stewardes of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternities hearing thereof, came vnto them and did aſſure both them and al the officers there ſhould be no diſorder at all committed, and deſiring them that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they would not let them be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to the other in their Martyrdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, yet at leaſt they might accompany them vnto their death, the which was gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, And ſo preſently they cauſed to be made vpon the Sea ſhore, a mile or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boutes from the Caſtle, a little houſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6796:62"/>with eight pillars of wood, putting in the mideſt therof and round about many boughes, and ſtraw, and dry canes: and to the end none might come neere the ſaid houſe they made a great pale round about it.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The day following, which was vpon the 7. of October, the Gouernors did ſignify vnto the deſigned Martyrs that, that very day the ſentence ſhould be put in execution: and ther with their ioyes were much increaſed, they giuing thouſandes of thankes vnto Almighty God for ſo great a benefit. Thoſe of the Confraternity caſting themſelues down before their feet, did congratulate their great happines, and deſired ſomething of them for a relique and memory: But they in al humble manner anſwered they feared they ſhould not bee worthy of ſo great a good, intreating them to pray to God for their perſeuerance: particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly <hi>Iames</hi> the little child of nyne yeares old, when any came to him to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulate his happy lot, that he ſhould be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6796:62"/>a martyr of Chriſt, he would run away from them ſaying: <hi>I am not yet a Martyr. Me thinkes I ſee the crowne and do deſire it much, but as yet I haue it not, and therefore it is yet to ſoone to giue me that honour and that name.</hi> They all of them put on their beſt apparel therin to go vnto their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, and ouer them they had long white garments like to ſurplices ſuch as thoſe of the Confraternity of <hi>Cochinot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zu</hi> did ordinarily vſe in their ſolemne feaſtes.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Now all of them being ready, thoſe of the Confraternity to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany them vnto the place of execution framed a proceſſion, and ſuch a one as the like perhapps was neuer ſeene before: For that in the middeſt of a Nation and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Gentills and Infidells, there went more them twenty thouſand Chriſtians euery one with his beades in his hands, all deſirous to be partaker of the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of thoſe that then were to dy. Firſt of all there went many of them before by ſix and ſix in a ranke: then came the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:6796:63"/>Martyrs, the handes of the men being faſt bound behind them, the womens looſe. The little <hi>Iames</hi> intreated very hard that they would tye his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds as they did the reſt, and ſcarce could they quiet him with telling him that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a cord to tye them withall. They went one by one betwixt the Stewardes or Prefectes of the Confraternity, with lighed candles in their hands in ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the light of faith in their minds and burning loue of God in their hartes, and after them a whole army of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſinging aloud the Letanies of our Bleſſed Lady. A vertuous man one of thoſe that went in the company, did offer to take vp <hi>Iames</hi> the little boy and to carry him in his armes, but he humbly refuſing his courteſy, ſayd: <hi>I pray you let me go on foote, for our Bleſſed Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt I take it, neyther went on horsbacke nor in a litter to be crucified, and after this little labour I hope I ſhall haue certaine and eternall reſt.</hi> Theſe wordes moued many that heard them vnto teares, and made
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:6796:63"/>the good man take vp the holy Child by force, and ſo he caried him vntil he came vnto the place of Martyrdome.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Being come thither, whileſt the Officers were buſy in binding them to the pillars of wood, at the which they were to bee burned, many came to take their leaues of them, and to get ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of their garmentes to keep as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques: In the meane while one of the Martyrs whoſe name was <hi>Leon Canyemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> ſtood vp, and ſpake aloud in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>We be come hither, good people, to dye in the manner you ſee for the honor and glory of Almighty God, and becauſe we knowe there is no other meanes, nor way vnto ſaluation but only by the holy Fayth of Ieſus Chriſt, and for it we ought not to make any recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of this preſent life. All you Chriſtians that are come hither with ſo great feruour do knowe this well inough, onely therefore we deſire you for a farewell that you perſeuer in the confeſſion of this fayth, without making any account in reſpect thereof of all that is in this world, no nor of your very liues.</hi> The
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:6796:64"/>reſt which he ſpeake could not be well heard.</p>
               <p n="20">. After they were all bound to their pillars, the Chriſtians lifted vp aloft, for the Martyrs and all the reſt to looke and meditate vpon, a very deuout picture of our Bleſſed Sauiour as he was bound to the pillar. Then the ſouldiers putting fire vnto the wood and ſtraw, the Holy Martyrs in the middeſt therof withall deuotion called vpon the help and fauour of our Bleſſed Sauiour often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes, to that end naming the moſt holy name of Ieſus, and al the Chriſtians vpon their knees did ſing the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Pater noſter, Aue Maria,</hi> and other praiers vntill the Martyrs had giuen their Holy Soules into the handes of God.</p>
               <p n="21">. <hi>Iames</hi> the little Child when the ropes were burned with which he was bound vnto his pillar, went treading vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Coales towardes his holy Mother, without euer offering to go out of the fire as he might haue done. As he went he ſayd three tymes aloud <hi>Ieſus Maria,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:6796:64"/>Ieſus Maria,</hi> and his Mother ſaid vnto him, <hi>looke vp my Child, looke vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;</hi> and ſo he did, and then fell downe and dyed. The Deuotion alſo of his holy ſiſter the Virgin <hi>Magdalen</hi> was much noted of ſome, and very worthily, for when her handes were looſed, the cordes wherewith they had beene bound being burned, ſhe tooke the hoate burning coales, &amp; put them on her head (for it is the cuſtome of the <hi>Iaponians</hi> when they like any thing which is giuen them, to put it on theyr heades) in token that ſhe did eſteeme them as a Gatland of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and as pretious pearles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with being crowned and adorned, ſhe deſired, and meant to meet her heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpouſe, whome ſhe loued aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges, and therewithall ſhe gaue her ſoule into his holy handes. <hi>Leon Canye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> making the ſigne of the Croſſe, gaue vp the Ghoſt, and all of them made happy endes, their ſoules being as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more inflamed with the fire of the loue of God, then their bodies ſcorched
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:6796:65"/>with the heate of the materiall fire.</p>
               <p n="22">. The Chriſtians who from the begining, as I ſayd before, were al vpon their knees in prayer, ſeeing that the holy Martyrs were now all dead, reuerenced their holy aſhes, and without regard of the officers leaped into the fire, &amp; tooke out thereof the Bleſſed bodies, although therby ſome of them receaued no ſmall hurt and domage by the fire. A man of worth got the handes of the holy Virgin &amp; Martyr <hi>Magdalen,</hi> and the Chriſtians of <hi>Conzara</hi> got her body: the other ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were caried in Coffins to <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> and there deliuered to the Father Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincial of the Society of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all poſſible ſolemnity, although not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique, they were placed in their Church, the Biſhop of <hi>Iapon, Don Luis Cerquyera</hi> being there preſent at that tyme, and a little after the body of the holy Virgin <hi>Magdalen</hi> was brought thither alſo, and laid with the reſt. So great was the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtians, that they neyther left pillar, nor coles that they did not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:6796:65"/>take away for Reliques of them.</p>
               <p n="23">23. The Lord Biſhop made an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall information of al this hiſtory, according to the cuſtome of the Church, and out of it was drawne that which is heere related. A little after vpon the 29. of October another man named <hi>Thomas</hi> was put to death for the ſame cauſe. He had beene baniſhed eight yeares before out of the Kingdome of <hi>Fingo</hi> for the fayth of Chriſt, &amp; at the preſent he had care of the Chriſtians of a certaine town, and he did it with ſuch care, diligence, and fruit, that many at his perſwaſion did confeſſe their fayth before the Iudges, and for that cauſe <hi>Arimadono</hi> comaunded him to be put to death, the which he endured very willingly, and calling continually vpon the Bleſſed name of Ieſus, made an happy end.</p>

They celebrated in the yeare 1613. the Night of our Bleſſed Sauiour his Natiuity in all the places afore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, with great ſolemnity, concourſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6796:66"/>and deuotion of the Chriſtians. And v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the 27. of December begon in <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> the firſt Thunder-clappe and ſigne of the future tempeſtuous ſtormes; <hi>Itacura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dono</hi> the Gouernour of the Citty coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the names of all the Chriſtians ſhould be taken and written downe in a Catalogue, and the ſame was done in <hi>Fuximi</hi> and <hi>Ozaca:</hi> the which cauſed no ſmall trouble among the Chriſtians, eſpecially they not knowing the cauſe and reaſon why it was ſo done, vntill at length there came two letters, the one from <hi>Safioye,</hi> the other from <hi>Xozamburo</hi> both of them great fauorites of the <hi>Xo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</hi> The firſt was directed to the Father Rector of the Society of <hi>Ieſus</hi> in <hi>Meaco,</hi> the ſecond to another Chriſtian a very friend of his, both of them dated from the Court vpon the eleauenth Moone: and the contentes were, that it had beene ſignified vnto the <hi>Xogun,</hi> that the Chriſtian Religion was ſuch, that thoſe that did profeſſe it, did neyther obey nor eſteeme of their Maiſters, Lordes, nor
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:6796:67"/>Princes, and that they did adore men put to death for Malefactors, tooke their fleſh and bones for Reliques (as they termed them) and wore them at their neckes. And for proofe therof they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated all that had paſſed about thoſe Chriſtians which had been burnt at <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> ſignifying that it had ſo beene told vnto him. And that moreouer very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians did of late publiquely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore a man that for his ruſt deſertes was crucified in <hi>Meace.</hi> For al which he being much offended ſaid, that, that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which teacheth ſuch doctrine, is doubtleſſe of the Druell, and therefore could not be tolerated in <hi>Iapone.</hi> In the end they ſaid that they were very ſory to ſend them ſo bad newes, but yet could not chuſe but let them vnderſtand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This blow did grieue the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians very much, and to the end they might better vnderſtand how the matter went, and procure ſome remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, after they had conſulted amongſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:6796:67"/>themſelues, they ſent vnto the Court a Brother of the Society, a man very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pext and intelligent, with intention that Father Rector ſhould alſo go thither to that end ſoone after him, <hi>Safioye</hi> had notice thereof, and meeting with the Brother reprehended him exceedingly, telling him moreouer, that now there was no remedy, for that the <hi>Xogun</hi> had giuen expreſſe Command that not one of all thoſe that taught the religion of Chriſt, whether they were ſtrangers or borne in the Country, ſhould remayne in all <hi>Iapone,</hi> and that therefore he ſhould returne immediatly vnto <hi>Meaco</hi> from whence he came.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The truth of the matter was, that when <hi>Safioye</hi> came vnto the Court he found that many there talked very much of the 28. Martyrs that had beene there put to death in the Moneth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt laſt paſt, as alſo of the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of thoſe that in <hi>Arima</hi> choſe rather to be burned aliue, then for one only houre deny their fayth: of the courage
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:6796:68"/>likewiſe of thoſe Chriſtians that went thither to ſee that ſpectacle, offering to dye with them, and how they reuerenced their Reliques. Some ſaid it was too great a cruelty, and that it had beene inough at the moſt to haue baniſhed them and conſiſcated their goodes: whereupon <hi>Safioye</hi> and others partly through the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred they bare vnto the fayth of Chriſt, and principally for the excuſing of their owne cruelties, did defame the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans vnto the <hi>Xogun,</hi> as diſobedient, ſtubborne and rebellious people, that they did not feare death, but rather did deſire to be put to death as Malefactors, and that they do eſteeme and adore ſuch like perſons; and a brother of <hi>Safioye</hi> did giue this reaſon thereof, becauſe ſaid he, Chriſt whome they hold for their Lord and Sauiour did dye vpon a Croſſe as a Malefactor.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But this proceeded from the late death of a Chriſtian that was crucified in this manner. Seauen perſons were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death in <hi>Meaca,</hi> for hauing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:6796:68"/>bought vncoyned ſiluer, as it ſeemeth, againſt ſome law of the country to that effect. Six of them were Gentills and the ſeauenth was a Chriſtian. The Gentills were beheaded, the Chriſtian was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Many people according to the cuſtome of all places went to ſee the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and when the Chriſtian gaue vp the Ghoſt, the Chriſtians that were preſent kneeled downe vpon their knees to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend his ſoule vnto God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſome of the Gentills, malicious perſones, tooke occaſion to giue out that they did adore him that was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And to excuſe their cruelty towards thoſe of the Prouince of <hi>Arima,</hi> they exagerated the matter, ſaying that if one only Prouince was ſo obſtinate, that there was no remedy to make them obey neyther their Prince nor the <hi>Xogun,</hi> what would it be if the greater part of <hi>Iapone</hi> were Chriſtians, as already they were very many in <hi>Meaco?</hi> adding withall that as long as the Fathers were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Iapone,</hi> it was not poſſible there
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:6796:69"/>ſhould be any remedy therein.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe and the like thinges they did paint out, and exaggerate in ſuch manner to the <hi>Xogun</hi> and the Prince his ſonne, who before were nothing well affected, but rather auerted from the Chriſtians by reaſon of the falſe reportes of the Gentills and Heretikes; that they reſolued to baniſh all the Fathers out of <hi>Iapone,</hi> and cruelly to perſecute the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians thereof: ſaying, that the Fathers as being ſtrangers and religious perſons were not much to be blamed for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of their religion, ſeeing it was their office and profeſſion ſo to do; but that euery Prince and Lord were worthy to be blamed that did permit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue and preach in their Countries; &amp; much more the Chriſtians there, that gaue eare vnto them, and did more eſteeme of the doctrine that was taught them by a few ſtrangers, then of that with their anceſtors had profeſſed, &amp; their Princes did imbrace and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand to be belieued &amp; followed, and that therefore they did
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:6796:69"/>only baniſh the Fathers without doing them any other hurt, or harme, but only depriuing them of their Churches and Houſes: wheras thoſe that were free De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizens ſhould be ſecretly puniſhed if they did not obey. And ſo the Catalogue was firſt to know how many Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s there were in thoſe places, &amp; then by that to procure that they ſhould all of them leaue their fayth: which was the ſelfe ſame manner they had vſed before with thoſe of <hi>Yendo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. All poſſible diligence was vſed by the Chriſtians to ſee if they could by any meanes make the <hi>Xogun</hi> capable of the truth of matters falſly feigned againſt them, and to giue him a true Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Catholique fayth. But the Princes of <hi>Iapone</hi> are of that nature and diſpoſition that if once in any thing they be reſolued, they ſcarce euer afterwards do change their mindes; neither is there almoſt any that will, or dare make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion vnto them for another, although it be in a matter the moſt iuſt that may
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:6796:70"/>be, eſpecially if the enemies of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be in fauour with the Prince, and themſelues be not to receaue ſome bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the buſines. Whereupon it came to paſſe vpon the 12. of February 1614. that notwithſtanding al the meanes that could be wrought, there was an expreſſe order made that al the Fathers in <hi>Iapone,</hi> with al thoſe that did belonge vnto them ſhould be ſent to <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> and there deliuered vnto their Superiors, and vnto the Gouernors of the Citty, &amp; that their Churches, &amp; houſes ſhould be caſt down.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Vpon the 14 of the ſame moneth this order was notified vnto the Fathers of the Society of <hi>Meaco,</hi> for that there was no other Church but theirs in that Citty, and they were required to giue vp a Catalogue of the names of all the Fathers, Brethren, and <hi>Doxucos,</hi> or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minariſtes, as alſo of the ſeruantes they had, to the end that none of them ſhould remaine behind. But becauſe it was very neceſſary that ſome ſhould ſtay ſecretly there for the helpe of the Chriſtians of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6796:70"/>that Citty, and of other townes and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages there about, of eight Fathers they put only three in the Catalogue, and of ſeauen Brethren other three, and of 20. Seminariſtes only ſix.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thoſe three Fathers and their company were baniſhed out of <hi>Meaco</hi> vpon the 21. of February, and there was an infinite concourſe of Gentills to ſee them (for the Chriſtians were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the officers to go;) ſome moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at them, others tooke compaſſion of them, conſidering the innocency where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they had liued amongſt them ſo many yeares. When they were come into <hi>Fuximi</hi> they found the Fathers of the holy Order of <hi>S. Francis</hi> that did dwell there already put in baotes ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and there they were all deliuered to a ſeruant of the Gouernor of <hi>Meaco,</hi> that was appointed to carry them to <hi>Nanga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaqui.</hi> Downe the riuer they went and came to <hi>Ozaca</hi> before the breake of day, and there were ioyned vnto them others of the Society, and of <hi>S. Francis</hi> his order
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6796:71"/>that did dwell in that Citty, as alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Father with others of the Society that were brought from the Kingdomes of <hi>Canga</hi> and <hi>Noto:</hi> ſo that vpon the 25. of that month there departed from <hi>Oza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> a reaſonable fleet of baniſhed perſons for the faith of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Before their departure Father Rector did offer vnto the Gouernors of <hi>Meaco</hi> and <hi>Ozaca</hi> a memoriall in which he anſwered to the falſe calumniations which were rayſed againſt the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fayth and Religion, deſiring them they would ſhew it vnto the <hi>Xogun,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme him of their innocenty. Both of them did read it, and ſayd that which was therin conteyned ſtood with very great reaſon, and that they thought that if the <hi>Xogun</hi> did ſe it he would deſiſt from perſecuting the Chriſtians. By the ſame order that thoſe already mentioned, were alſo baniſhed the Fathers of the Society that dwelt in <hi>Firoxima,</hi> and in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Aqui, Bingo, Bungo,</hi> and <hi>Figen,</hi> of the country of <hi>Omura,</hi> the Ilandes of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6796:71"/>
                  <hi>Xiqui,</hi> and <hi>Conzura,</hi> as alſo before had beene in the yeares 1612. and 1613. thoſe of <hi>Bugen Chicugo, Chicugen,</hi> together with the Fathers of <hi>S. Auguſtins</hi> order of <hi>Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,</hi> and the Fathers of <hi>S. Dominicke</hi> of the Kingdome of <hi>Fijcn.</hi> Finally in all <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone</hi> there did not remaine ſo much as one Church which was not caſt downe and deſtroyed, all the Religious men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the port of <hi>Nangaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,</hi> except ſome few that lay hidden and went ſecretly diſguiſed in diuers partes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Society had at that time in <hi>Nangaſaqui</hi> foure ſeuerall Reſidences, the Colledge and Seminary all in one, the <hi>Miſericordia,</hi> the Hoſpitall, and the howſe of All-ſaints, and other two they had not far from thence: there were alſo three Couentes there, one of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> his order, another of <hi>S. Dominicke,</hi> and the third of <hi>S. Francis.</hi> There were more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer foure pariſh Churches of ſecular Prieſtes that were <hi>Iaponians</hi> borne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other leſſer Chappells. The number
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:6796:72"/>of the Churches that were deſtroyed in all partes of <hi>Iapone,</hi> may be gathered by that which the Society alone did looſe in the yeare 1612. when the perſecution did but begin in <hi>Arima</hi> (although it were not vniuerſall) which were foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ſeauen Reſidences, Churches, and Chappells. It would be to tedious a matter to write in particuler all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtations &amp; vexations which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians receaued vpon this occaſion, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with their valour, courage, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and conſtancy therin, the which is nothing diminiſhed by the frailty which ſome exteriourly did ſhew, ſeeing that it is no nouelty that ſome in all places be not ſo conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in religion as they ſhould: euen in <hi>Europe</hi> it ſelfe where Chriſtian Religion moſt floriſheth, and is of moſt continuance we haue to many examples thereof, yea and which is more in the very primitiue Church of Chriſt, there neuer wanted ſome, that were vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, cowardly, to too fearefull, &amp; faint harted.</p>

               <p>MEACO is the moſt populous &amp; ancient Citty of <hi>Iapone,</hi> and the ordinary Court of the <hi>Dayri,</hi> who by right is the true Lord of all thoſe Kingdomes. It is the very well ſpring &amp; fountaine of al the Idolatry of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and hath in it many Temples and <hi>Bonzoes. Fuximi</hi> is another Citty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſix miles from <hi>Meaco,</hi> although it be now almoſt ioyned with the ſuburbes thereof. It was builded by <hi>Taycoſama</hi> the predeceſſor of the <hi>Xogun</hi> that now reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, who hath there a goodly great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, and it is his Garriſon towne for the partes of <hi>Camy.</hi> There he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually 6000. ſouldiers vnder the charge of 4. Captaines, and the Generall of them all is <hi>Oquindono</hi> who is his owne brother. <hi>Ozaca</hi> is 20. miles lower down
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:6796:73"/>the riuer towards the Weſt, and is alſo a very populous Citty, hath many goodly Pallaces in it, &amp; one of the beſt fortreſſes if not the beſt of all <hi>Iapone. Taycoſama</hi> did build it, and his ſonne <hi>Fideyor</hi> doth dwel in it to this day, <hi>Sacay</hi> is ſix miles more towards the South, and the Inhabitants thereof be all Merchantes and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In euery one of theſe Cittyes there were good ſtore of Chriſtians, and all of them, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Meaco</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaca,</hi> where were the greater number, hearing of this newes did endeauour to moue themſelues to feruour and deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The two Gouernors <hi>Itacuradono</hi> and <hi>Ichinocami</hi> did deſire to put as few Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians into the Catalogue as might be, partly becauſe they ſaw it was a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt miuſtice that was intended towards them, and partly leaſt they themſelues ſhould be blamed and rebuked for that there were ſo many. But all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, euen the very Children, would needes haue their names written in the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6796:73"/>Catalogue; for that in <hi>Meaco</hi> alone there were at that tyme more then fower thouſand, whoſe names were taken. Some there were that were then but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſing of themſelues in Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing to be Chriſtians, and were not yet baptized, that did put in their names a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, and more then threeſcore at that very tyme were baptized, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the troubles likely to enſew, affirming that they ſhould hould the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for very happy to dy in ſo holy a religion: and among the reſt an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent woman of threeſcore and ten yeares old, that had very often reſiſted vnto Gods calling and holy inſpirations giuen her to be a Chriſtian, a very little before the departure of the Fathers was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, to the great contentment of her ſelfe, and all her Chriſtian freindes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was a little Child in <hi>Sacay</hi> who ſaying to his parents that he would be a Martyr with them, and they telling him, that if he could not ſuffer a little ſparke of fire on his hand, how would he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6796:74"/>ſuffer greater tormentes, he tooke a hoat burning iron to try it in his hand if he could endure it: his parentes detayned him, but could not quiet him vntill they promiſed him they would carry him with them when they went to dy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There was another young youth nephew to a certaine <hi>Bonzo</hi> whoſe Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple and Benefice he was to haue inherited, and becauſe he made himſelfe a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, his owne Father hung him by the feet and whipped him cruelly, but for all that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would neuer leaue inſiſting that they ſhould put his name downe in the Catalogue of Chriſtians, becauſe he was he ſaid a Chriſtian, and ſo would liue and die. For which cauſe his Father did diſinherite him, and violently thruſt him out of his houſe, and he went ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to the Fathers of the Society, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king earneſt ſuite to go away with them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All this tyme there was an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary concourſe of the Chriſtians vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Churches, notwithſtanding all
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6796:74"/>the floutes and mockes, and reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Gentills: much frequenting of the Sacraments and prayer, and the prayer of forty houres was almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually kept in many places: and it was the generall care of al by meanes of theſe holy exerciſes and diuers penances they did, to prepare themſelues to dye. They were much grieued to depart from their ſpirituall Fathers &amp; maiſters, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether they ſhould euer ſee them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine or no, and ſo great and griuous was their lamentation for this reſpect, that the very Gentills tooke great pitty and compaſſion both of them and the Fathers alſo, ſaying publikely, that the officers that hindered them, did them great wrong and iniury not to let them go in their company, ſeeing they did ſo much deſire it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Vpon the 16 of February <hi>Sanga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midono</hi> one of the principall Captaines and Tutor to the Prince of <hi>Yendo</hi> came to <hi>Meaco</hi> with a hundred and fifty horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and many more on foote vnder
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:6796:75"/>pretence to pull downe the Churches, and deſtroy the Chriſtians, although as we ſhal ſee heerafter the <hi>Xogun</hi> had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intention therein. The next day following, he commanded to caſt down the Church and Houſe of the Society, and to carry the wood thereof to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſide, making a Proclamation that all that would not deny their faith ſhould be burned with that wood, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one ſhould prepare his pillar of wood whereunto to be tyed when they ſhould be burned. Many immediatly got them pillers and ſet them ready at their dores, others that had no money to buy them withall, ſould ſome of their houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould ſtuffe, becauſe when the tyme came they would not be without them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And they in this manner expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the happy day of Martyrdome, the foreſayd wood was commanded to be burned publikely, togeather with the wood of two other Chappells, and of the Churches of <hi>Ozaca, Fuximi,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sacay</hi> to the great griefe and affliction of all
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:6796:75"/>the Chriſtians, and thereby they came to vnderſtand, that all that had beene done was only to terrify and put them into a feare. For <hi>Sangamidono</hi> and the Gouernors of <hi>Meaco</hi> &amp; <hi>Ozaca</hi> ſeing their inuincible courage, determined firſt of all to aſſault them by meanes of their freindes, neighbors and kinred, and if that did not preuaile, then to diſgrace ſome of them publikely, and to blot out of the Catalogue the names of others eyther by force, or by deceipt, to comply in that manner with the <hi>Xogun;</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to giue him notice o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly of thoſe that were in their iudgments moſt rebellious and obſtinate.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Preſently hereupon the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, freinds, and kinſfolkes of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians begone to enter in troupes into their houſes, ſome breaking downe and tearing in peeces the pictures of our Sauiour and his Saintes, ſome taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their beades and <hi>Agnus Deis,</hi> and all other ſignes of Chriſtianity they found: others partly with threates, partly with
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:6796:76"/>intreaties and importunities, inſiſting that at the leaſt they would conſent that their names might be blotted out of the Catalogue. This Combat did endure a good while and diuers were the euentes thereof. Few were ouercome: a great number eyther by force or by decept had their names blotted out of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue: and the moſt conſtant were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably vexed and afflicted.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There was in <hi>Meaco</hi> a certaine ſtreet called the ſtreet of the Chriſtians, becauſe al that dwelt therein (except one only family) were ſo, with theſe they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed extraordinary diligence to make them leaue their fayth, and becauſe they could not preuaile with them, they bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed two families as heades of all the reſt, and then in the ſight of their husbands and fathers they put 27. perſons, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, into certaine ſackes of ſtraw into the which they vſe to put their rice, and tying them with cordes round about from top to toe, they caſt them one vpon another, as though they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:6796:76"/>had beene ſackes of corne, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, becauſe they ſhould not be ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, they laid them in the ſtreets vpon the ground, leauing them ſo for all men to behold a whole day and a night, in exceeding cold weather and ſnow, with men to keep them, who continually did importune them that they would yeald at leaſt in ſomething or other. But for all this, and all they could do, they could not ouercome them. Yea other children there were that wept and cried very ſeriouſly, becauſe they were not put and tyed in ſackes as their mothers and their ſiſters were; and to quiet them there was no other way but to put them in, where withall the Gentills did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine aſtoniſhed.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The day following the Iudges did returne, and affirming that the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes of thoſe women were not men, ſeeing they were not moued with the diſgrace and puniſhment of their wiues and children, they commanded they women to be looſed, and the men to be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:6796:77"/>tyed in the ſackes, and put to the ſame torment that their wiues were put vnto the day before, threatning them that if they did not deny their faith they would cauſe them to be carried in that manner vpon a ſtaffe through all the ſtreetes of the citty, to their publique ſhame igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny and diſgrace. But by the grace of God they made ſmall reckoning of their threates. Then came there thither a great troupe of Gentills, who firſt, giuing them many reproachfull wordes and ſpeaches, did afterwardes intreat the Iudges that they would deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into their cuſtody, &amp; that they in their houſes would giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch counſaile, as ſhould be conuenient for them. And ſo it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, becauſe indeed they were loath to fill the priſons full of Chriſtians; whoſe wordes in all this tyme were nothing but proteſtations, that they would ſo remayne (by the aſſiſtance of the holy Choſt) vntill their dying day.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Neere vnto the Church of <hi>Meaco</hi> there liued in a houſe all together very
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:6796:77"/>recollectedly diuers Gentlewomen that had made vowes of Chaſtity in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of a noble Lady called <hi>Iulia,</hi> ſiſter vnto <hi>Don Iohn Naytodono,</hi> of whome ſhortly we ſhall make mention. This Lady remayning widow after the death of her husband who was a principall Lord of the Kingdome of <hi>Tamba,</hi> left the world being yet a Gentile to be a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuni,</hi> which is a kind of religious life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentills, and ſo ſhe remained for the ſpace of fourteene yeares, liuing in great pouerty and penance, ſpending her time in doing many heatheniſh rites and ceremonies, for the which ſhe was greatly eſteemed of many of the moſt noble Ladies of all the Land, and of all of that ſect which ſhe profeſſed, although the longer ſhe liued in that faſhion the leſſe quietnes ſhe found in her Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It pleaſed Almighty God to open her eyes as another <hi>Lydia</hi> in the actes of the Apoſtles by hearing the ſermons of the Catechiſme which were preached by a Brother of the Society who was a <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penian</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:6796:78"/>borne: and allthough her ancient cuſtome and the ſpeach of the world weighed very much, and were great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to hinder her conuerſion, yet the grace and calling of Almighty God being more potent and powerful, within a ſhort tyme ſhe came to ſee the error of the <hi>Iaponian</hi> Sects wherein ſhe had beene very conuerſant, &amp; to know the truth of our holy Chriſtian and Catholike Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and was baptized by F. <hi>Organ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino</hi> of the Society of Ieſus in the yeare 1596. after which diuers perſecutions were raiſed againſt her by the <hi>Bonzos</hi> for leauing of their ſect; and becauſe ſhe had burned certaine Idolls which they eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very much, they procured the <hi>Xogu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> to made enquiry after her, to puniſh her therefore; and vpon that occaſion ſhe was forced to liue ſecretly diuers yeares. She gaue herſelfe wholy to deuotion and became thereby to be ſo good a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſo ſpirituall, that ſhe together with her company did exceeding much good among the Gentills, teaching the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6796:78"/>Religion to diuers Ladies &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen whome they viſited, to whom no man could poſſibly haue any entrance or acceſſe, and by her meanes many ſoules were deliuered from the Diuells power, and her howſe was as it were a place of refuge for the Chriſtian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſuch was her vertue, ſuch her wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſuch the good example ſhe gaue to all.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Iudges togeather with the Gouernors Nephews were fiue daies in endeauouring to make theſe good Gentlewomen leaue fayth, ſometymes by faire means ſomtymes by foule; and finally for a concluſion they tould them that hauing vnderſtood that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians did deſire to dye for their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were reſolued not to fullfill their deſires therein, but otherwiſe to afflict them by all meanes poſſible, and afterwardes cauſe then to be carried naked through the ſtreetes of <hi>Meaco</hi> to their publike ſhame, and then to baniſh them into diuers partes, ſo that they
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6796:79"/>ſhould neuer ſee one another more, and to ſuch places where they could not liue as Chriſtians, &amp; that all this they might eaſily remedy with diſſembling a little exteriourly, and conſenting that their names might be blotted out of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. They anſwered they would not, and that if they did blot out their names by force, they would publikely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme that they were Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The Iudges went away, and the good Gentlewomen afterwardes did expect euery moment when the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers would come: at length there came a whole troup of them, and the holy women went out to meete with them, each carrying a ſacke in her hand, into which preſently the officers did thruſt them, and bynd them ſo hard that they could neyther moue hand nor foote, and then they tyed them to ſtaues and ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them vpon their ſhoulders through the ſtreets accompanied with many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men. The people came all out of their houſes to ſee them, ſome mocking
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:6796:79"/>at them and abuſing them, others admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at their conſtancy. They put them in a publike place without the Citty, where they vſe to execute Iuſtice vpon malefactors, and their they remayned all that day and the next, expoſed to the could and ſnowy weather. Great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of people went thither to ſee them, and among the reſt a certaine <hi>Bonzo,</hi> who comming ful of pride and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſaid vnto them, that they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant women, that they ſhould rely vpon him who was a learned man, and that he would take vpon him their ſaluation: they laughing at his folly gaue him no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwere, that being ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found his proud preſumption. Certaine Gentills did procure to deliuer one of them, and by force did carry her from thence vnto her Fathers houſe, but ſhe went all the way crying out aloud, <hi>I am a Christian, I am a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and when they let her go ſhe tooke vp the ſacke and the ropes wherewith ſhe had beene tyed in her handes, and neuer ceaſed (running
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:6796:80"/>through more then ten ſtreetes, till ſhe came againe to the place where her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were, and there ſhe made her ſelfe to be bound againe as they were, to both her owne and their great ioy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort &amp; content. The next day the Iudges ſent word to looſe and let them go, but they vnderſtanding that it was a deuiſe thereby to giue out to the world that they had now yealded, they ſaid, <hi>We are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and will not go from hence, vnleſſe you go proclaiming that we wil not leaue our holy fayth and Religion, and if you will not do ſo, let vs remaine heere vntill we dy.</hi> As they required ſo was it done, for they tooke, and tyed them, and carried them backe againe through the ſame ſtreetes they brought them, proclayming that they ſtill remayned Chriſtians, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues likewiſe did proclaime the ſame ſaying all the way, <hi>we are Chriſtians, we are Chriſtians.</hi> They brought them to a houſe of a certaine Chriſtian, and there they left them giuing them backe againe their beades, and <hi>Agnus Deis.</hi>

There he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained vntill he was baniſhed. This tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tying in the ſackes was ſo great, that moſt of them, or all did fall ſicke therof.</p>

In <hi>Ozaca</hi> was the ſame affliction and perſecution as in <hi>Meaco,</hi> and the conſtancy of the Chriſtians there no leſſe then in the other place. Thoſe that went abroad about any buſines left at home in writing how they were Chriſtians, &amp; that if there were any torments to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for being ſo, they would returne preſently to ſuffer them. Others that were abroad when the newes was told them of the perſecution, left preſently their buſineſſe for the ſame end. Some young youthes were moſt cruelly whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by their parentes for being Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ſhut vp without any meate at all for a long tyme. Then aroſe a report that vpon a certaine day, at ſuch an houre, the Chriſtians ſhould be put to death, in ſuch a market place. Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon diuers of them did begin to giue all that they had vnto the poore: and vpon the day appointed before the hour came, there were more then three hundred come and expected in the place, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more there would haue beene, had

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:6796:84"/>
                  <hi>Itacuradono</hi> laughing at them, ſaid: It ſeemes you do not know them, nor the willingnes &amp; contentment with which they go into baniſhment. I ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad I could deteyn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion I haue of them. Goe with ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for thoſe that goe in the manner that they do, will not run away I warrant you. Take my word, for I knowe them very well.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſo happened, that the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers bringing threeſcore and thirteene horſes for them to ride vpon vnto a place where they were to take ſhipping, one horſe was ouerplus by reaſon that a little boy that was one of the forſaid number being hidden by his kinsfolkes, was wanting: and the Officers reflecting vpon it and ſaying that one of them was wanting, a young youth that was come thither to take his leaue of ſome of thoſe that were to go into baniſhment, hearing them, ſtept out and ſaid; <hi>Here I am, take no care there is none wanting,</hi> and ſaying ſo, he leaped vpon the ſpare horſe, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:6796:85"/>with great content went along with the reſt into baniſhment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They went all in a row one after another, moſt of them very richly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, and exceedingly content. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at many of the Gentills wondred not a little, ſeeing that in their conceipt they had reaſon rather to ſhew griefe then any contentment at all in that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Diuers Chriſtians accompanied them to <hi>Otzu,</hi> with teares and a kind of holy enuy, emulating their happines in ſuffering that which they did for Chriſt. And they all that way went aminating thoſe that were to returne and remaine there behind, not to ſhew any weakenes, frailty or cowardize in Gods cauſe, nor to feare neyther loſſe of goodes nor life, ſeeing that all in compariſon of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life is but of ſmall, or of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Fathers of the Society that liued at that tyme ſecretly and diſguiſed in <hi>Meaco,</hi> the better thereby to help the Chriſtians, did very much deſire to haue
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:6796:85"/>acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied theſe their Ghoſtly children, but it being both neceſſary for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good of others not to diſcouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and daungerous to do it, they therfore ſent a good Chriſtian, a <hi>Iaponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> borne, vnto them in their names, a man of much vertue and great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to help and animate them in their iorney, who willingly with all his hart did vndertake that care, being indeed himſelf deſirous to dye with them. They ſtayed in the port vntill the middeſt of May, expecting wind to ſayle the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Seas. Thither in that tyme many Chriſtians went to viſit them, and by a letter which one of them wrote vnto a Father of the Society of <hi>Ozaca</hi> may be gathered the manner of their going, and how they did behaue themſelues: thus he wrote.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Vpon the</hi> 22. <hi>of the third Moone</hi> (which was vpon the 30. of Aprill) <hi>I went to viſit the baniſhed perſons which then were in</hi> Tzurunga: <hi>&amp; I remayned ſo edified by them, that I do aſſure you I felt in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6796:86"/>extraordinary ſhame and confuſion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied together with deuotion. All of them both men and women had cauſed the hayre of their heads to be ſhauen of: euery day three ſeuerall tymes they made their prayer altogeather, and at euery tyme they ſpent an houre therein: they had ſo diſtributed matters among themſelues, that euery one did ſome office or other to help and ſerue the reſt. When they came to</hi> Tzurunga, <hi>they were all put in a great warehouſe, the dores faſt locked vpon them, and there they paſſed all that night vpon the cold bare ground: and exceeding glad they were that therein they did in ſome manner imitate the martyrs, of whoſe afflictions and torments they did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe amongſt themſelues. The night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing they had giuen them two matts to lye and ſleep vpon: their meate whileſt they remayned there, was a little rice with pottage made of certaine hearbes, that were (God knowes) of an vnpleaſant tast. The Captaines that conducted them ſaid once vnto them: Becauſe you were many and moſt of you ſkill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in matters of armes, we made ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty

And verily with this reſolution you haue ſhewed in chooſing rather to be baniſhed then leaue your fayth, you haue giuen an euident testimony that it is the truth, and the right way vnto ſaluation: and if you had not done ſo, you had put a great blot vpon your religion, and giuen teſtimony that all which it teacheth were falſe and vntrue: and doubtleſſe if the prohibition of the Prince were not ſo ſtrict as it is, we would he are the ſermons of ſo good and holy a doctrine. This and much more I might write vnto you, of that which the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines ſayd, moued with their good example.</hi> Hitherto the letter.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They departed afterwards from that port, and ariued ſafey at the place whereunto they were baniſhed, &amp; there as was after ſignified, they were well receaued and alſo holpen by the Prince thereof. The Gentlewomen whereof I ſpake before, together with others were ſent in baniſhment to <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> where
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:6796:87"/>they were releeued by the charity of the Confraternities, eſpecially by that of the <hi>Miſericordia.</hi> Some alſo were baniſhed at this tyme from <hi>Fuximi.</hi> There was alſo one <hi>Peter</hi> a were graue man and an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſouldier much reſpected by <hi>Oquindo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> the <hi>Xoguns</hi> Brother, who had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored much to make him leaue his fayth, and not obteyning it, he ſent him word that it was the <hi>Xoguns</hi> pleaſure, that ther ſhould not remayne one Chriſtian in all <hi>Iapone;</hi> that the Fathers were now bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and the Churches deſtroied; &amp; that he could do no leſſe but baniſh him if he did not leaue to be a Chriſtian: to which he anſwered: <hi>I did not make my ſelfe a Chriſtian becauſe there be Fathers or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in Iapone, but becauſe I knewe there was no other way to ſaue my ſoule. I am very ſorry that they are baniſhed, and that the Churches be destroyed: but yet I knowe that he that brought the from the furtheſt partes of the world hither, can more eaſily bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe from</hi> Macan <hi>&amp;</hi> Iuſon <hi>which is nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</hi> The Xogun <hi>can do no more but put

Some frends of his that were Gentils did ſecretly entreate the Gouernors that they
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:6796:88"/>they would diſſemble with him for a while, &amp; that they would be his ſuerties that he ſhould conforme himſelfe. The Gouernors were very wel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent withal, but he hauing notice thereof went vnto them ſaying, <hi>That he was a Chriſtian, and that he would not leaue to be ſo for all the world, and that therefore they might reſolue eyther to kill him, or baniſhe him as they pleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. They were much griued therat but there being no other remedy they ſent him to <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> doing him the fauour not to confiſcate his goodes. Scarſe was he arriued there, it being 200. leagues from whence he went, but there came letters vnto him from <hi>Meaco</hi> that <hi>Marina</hi> his wife &amp; her litle daughter ſhould preſently returne to <hi>Fuximi,</hi> but not ſignifiyng wherefore, nor for what cauſe it was. They were all much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled therewith, and very loth to part one from the other, but yet for all that they returned according to the commaund both of them with great reſolution firſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:6796:88"/>cutting off their haire. The Gouernors did intend eyther by threats or flatteries to make <hi>Marina</hi> yeald at leaſt a little, &amp; then by her meanes winne her huſband to their will, but ſhe anſwered very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, <hi>that although they ſhould kill her, or make her a ſlaue to be a drudge al the daies of her life in a kitchen, ſhe would not change her minde.</hi> The Gouernors with this ſo vnexpected anſwere remained as it were aſtoniſhed, for they thought infallibly that ſhe would eaſily yeald, ſeeing her ſelfe alone, without her husband, and forſaken of her friendes, and thereupon they let her go: and ſhe and her daughter returned both very ioyful to <hi>Nangaſaqui</hi> hauing now made three iorneyes each of them 200. leagues a peece.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In <hi>Meaco</hi> the officers had blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out the names of diuers Chriſtians in the Catalogue, of ſome by force, of others by fraudulent, and deceiptfull meanes, the parties themſelues ſome of them openly repugning thereunto; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being content to winke thereat,

                  <hi>This is the cauſe</hi> (ſayd they) <hi>why we come hither to let you and all the world knowe, that we neuer left to be Chriſtians, and that for our religion we are ready to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer torments, yea and death it ſelfe.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they laid hold on them al, &amp; bound them with ſuch cruelty that their hands, their neekes, and armes did ſwell excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: and <hi>Itacuradono,</hi> fearing that all the Chriſtians would do the ſame that they had done, did reuyle them bitterly and told them, that if they did not obey he would command that the men ſhould be carried about the ſtreetes to publique ſhame, and the women to the ſtewes: and they all anſwering that they would neuer obey in that matter, preſently they tooke the women and carried them to the foreſaid place, and the men through the principall ſtreetes with a great and ſtrange tumultuous noyſe, and vpon a little bord, in a paper, their ſentence writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thus: <hi>For being Chriſtians hauing once left their fayth;</hi> the which was falſe.

That night they were carried backe againe to priſon, and there they lay with irons at their neckes. The next day they were carried to the bridge of their ſtreet, there to be tyed to the poſtes of it, and becauſe the officers ſhould vſe no mercy towardes them, the Iudge ſaid vnto them: <hi>Looke that you do as I comand you, for the Gouernour is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding angry that you tyed them ſo gently this laſt night, that two or three of them hath not the ſkinne rubbed of from their neckes with the ropts.

Three dayes they vſed them in this faſhion, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills and the <hi>Bonzos</hi> comming thither continually to perſwade them to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelues vnto the tyme: but they little regarding their perſwaſions ſaid vnto them: <hi>Looke vpon vs, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that to ſuffer that which we do willingly, and with the ioy you ſee is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſigne, that in our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is meanes of ſaluation.</hi> After they had done all this with them, they carried them backe againe to priſon, in which from Iuly of the yeare 1614. vntil March 1615. when this Relation was written they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne ſuffering with great conſtancy in their fayth, &amp; ioy in their afflictions.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The valour of their wiues and daughters in that infamous place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they were ſent, was in my mind wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:6796:91"/>eternall memory, for to the end that no man that looked vpon them ſhould luſt after or deſire them, many of them did disfigure their owne faces, making them all on a gore blood, with little woundes they made in them.

               <p n="2">2. He had in his Kingdome diuers noble Chriſtians Captaines and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer <hi>Don Iuſto Tacayama Minaminobo,</hi> whoſe memory is famous in the hiſtories of the Society of Ieſus of the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> and <hi>Iapone,</hi> and <hi>Nayto Don Iohn Toruan</hi> who was Lord of almoſt al the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Tamha:</hi> and <hi>Nayto Don Thomas Vacmodono</hi> his ſonne, and <hi>Oquinada Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Quicuan</hi> a principall Gentleman of <hi>Bigen.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:6796:92"/>ſome Father of the Society, and a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and others of the Seminary that was in the Citty of <hi>Canazoua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When the newes of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came firſt into thoſe partes, <hi>Don Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto</hi> did determine to keepe the Father ſecretly, to the end he might help the Chriſtians there in caſe they came to dye for their fayth, as all did hope and deſire they ſhould. But preſently there came a comand from the <hi>Xogun,</hi> that the Father and thoſe that were with him ſhould be carried by officers vnto <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> and ſo it was of neceſſity put in execution: but before his departure ſo great was the concourſe of the Chriſtians to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelues, to receaue the Bleſſed Sacrament, and to take their leaues of him, that the Church was ſcarce euer empty eyther day or night. Three dayes after his departure together with the reſt of his company, <hi>Figendono</hi> did by order from the <hi>Xogun</hi> comand (though much againſt his will) that <hi>Don Iusto, Don Iohn</hi> and <hi>Don Thomas</hi> with their Wiues, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:6796:92"/>and Grandchildren ſhould be cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Meaco,</hi> and deliuered to <hi>Itacuradono,</hi> and that all their ſeruantes ſhould be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed if they did not leaue to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Great was the aſſault that was giuen them there to accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the tyme, leaſt otherwiſe they ſhould vndoe themſelues, and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruinate their Families, which were of ſo great name, fame, and nobility. But they as men experienced in ſuch like Combats, hauing loſt before at other tymes, and ventured for their fayth, more then they could do now, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moued therwith: ſaying that to honeſt men, and ſuch as know what it is to be Chriſtians, no man ought to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any ſuch matter, no not in way of ieſt or merriment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. One only day was giuen them to prepare themſelues towards their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ſo leauing their landes, liuings, wealth, weapons, howſes and eſtates, without any more then their only appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell on their backes, and ſome thinges
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:6796:93"/>neceſſary for the way, they tooke their iorney to <hi>Canozaua</hi> vpon the 15. day of February. So <hi>Don Iusto</hi> like another <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> left his Country, togeather with his wife <hi>Iuſta</hi> and fiue <hi>Grandchildren,</hi> (the eldeſt whereof was 16. yeares old and the yongeſt 8.) and his daughter who was married vnto the ſonne and heire of the Gouernour of thoſe three kingdomes, a man worth forty thouſand ducats by the yeare. This Lady for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reaſons, and principally becauſe ſhe deſired to dy in this occaſion with her Father, went with him, her huſband being very willing therewith. He was alſo a Chriſtian, and deſired much to haue accompanied his Father-in-law, but for iuſt occaſions he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him. And ſo hauing made a generall confeſſion of all his life with a Father of the Society before his departure, he remained there expecting what would be the euent of theſe troubles, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if God gaue him life to ſend after for his wife: and both of them to dy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:6796:93"/>for the faith of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When they went out of the Citty the Gentills did feare there would haue beene made ſome vprore, by reaſon <hi>Don Iusto</hi> had ſo many ſeruantes, freindes, and wellwillers there, and that all the world ſaw euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the manifeſt wrong and iniuſtice that was done to him, and the reſt, and therefore they did arme themſelues to preuent whatſoeuer might happen. But he ſent them word, they needed not to feare, ſaying: <hi>That now he was not to fight with weapons as at other tymes they had ſeene him do, but with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and humility, as the Law of God doth teach.</hi> Many people did accompany them a little on their way, ſome weeping to ſee ſuch men that were a little before ſo rich and ſo eſteemed in the Kingdome, to go now out of it in baniſhment, in pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and with officers to guard, them, not hauing done the leaſt offence or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any fault at all. Others admyring to ſee ſuch courage and conſtancy in them, ſayd: <hi>Doubtleſſe the Chriſtian religion
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:6796:94"/>muſt needes be very good, ſeeing that men of ſo good Iudgment &amp; vnderſtanding as theſe be, ſo wiſe, noble and valiant do for it ſo little eſteeme, and ſo lightly regard their liues, &amp; make ſo ſmal account of their goods, honors &amp; eſtates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. At the end of the firſt daies iorney it was told them, that ſome were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards them with order to put them all to death, the which when they heard, with great ioy and gladnes they al ſetled themſelues to their prayers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making the leaſt ſigne of ſadnes, or ſhew of reſiſtance in the world: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when afterwards they vnderſtood it was a falſe all-arme, they were very ſorry, and grieued that it proued not ſo as it was reported.</p>
               <p n="7">7. After ten daies iourney they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at <hi>Sacamoto,</hi> three leagues from <hi>Meaco,</hi> hauing endured much miſery in the way paſſing ouer many high hills &amp; craggy mountaines full of ſnow, which they could not go ouer but on foot: and <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> being ſo old as he was, &amp; ſicke
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:6796:94"/>withall, was yet ſtill the firſt, ammating ſo much the reſt that euen the children and yong damſells which neuer before knew what hardnes meant, went with as great contentement ouer thoſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, dabling in the wet, and trampling in the ſnow, as if they had beene wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in ſtately Pallaces, and pleaſant galleries.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Itacuradono</hi> vnderſtood of their comming, and fearing that if they ſhould come into the Citty, the Chriſtians thereof would bee to much e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>couraged, he wrote vnto the two Captaines that garded them that they ſhould ſtay in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camoto</hi> vntill they had further order fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Xogun.</hi> It ſeemed vnto <hi>Don Iusto</hi> that their ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce would be one of theſe three thinges: eyther that they ſhould be put to death there, or els carried to <hi>Yendo</hi> &amp; <hi>Suruga,</hi> and there made an end of with torments and diſgrace, or finally bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed vnto diuers Kingdomes, that ſo being ſeparated one from the other, they would aſſault them euery one by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:6796:95"/>to make them leaue their fayth, telling them that the reſt had conformed themſelues and condeſcended to their will. And this laſt he feared moſt of all by reaſon of the children and women that were among them, leaſt they therby might be circumuented, &amp; for that cauſe he did preuent them with inſtructions, bidding them they ſhould not giue any credit to ſuch like falſe reportes: and wiſhing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo that thought they ſhould heare that their owne parentes, and all other Chriſtians had denyed their fayth, they ſhould remanyne yet conſtant and perſeuerant, ſeeing that, that was the only and ſecure way to ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="9">9. At the end of thirty dayes, there came a ſentence from the <hi>Xogun,</hi> that the men ſhould be baniſhed to <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> and that the women if they would might remaine in <hi>Meaco,</hi> but that they ſhould not carry any ſeruantes at all with them. The women would not part from the men, but went with them; and in the iourney, which did endure 20. dayes,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:6796:95"/>for want of ſeruantes, and vpon other occaſions, they paſſed much miſery and incomodity, yet at length they ariued all at <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> and were there very well receaued.</p>
               <p n="10">10. There were beſides theſe diuers other principall Gentlemen baniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Canozaua,</hi> and ſent to <hi>Tzugarum,</hi> and in particuler <hi>Thomas Quiucan</hi> with his three ſonnes who were men growne and alſo of good eſtates. This <hi>Thomas</hi> was one of the principall Captaines of the prince of <hi>Bigen,</hi> and of two other Kingdomes. He had beene of the ſect of <hi>Toequexus,</hi> and ſo obſtinate therein, that although his ſonns and freinds were moſt of them Chriſtians, yet was it not poſſible to make him leaue his Sect, vntill it pleaſed Almighty God to open his eyes in the yeare 1600. by meanes of a Father of the Society. But afterwards he became ſo feruorous and deuout a Chriſtian, that he was an example to them all. He had a certaine faire Grange wherto he often retired to recollect himſelfe, to giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:6796:96"/>to prayer, to read good bookes, and do diuers kind of pennances. <hi>Figendono</hi> did eſteeme of him ſo-much that he made him one of the foure Iudges of all his Eſtate, and for this cauſe greater were the aſſaultes that were giuen vnto him, and his Sonnes: but they defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo manfully, that they with three other Gentlemen rather choſe to looſe their goodes, rentes, and reuenues, and to be baniſhed out of their naturall ſoyle, then to yeald in any the leaſt thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their fayth.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In the ſame Citty there was a chieſe Noble man, who hauing diuers ſeruantes that were Chriſtians, did vſe many perſwaſions to one of them that he would leaue it. But he anſwered: <hi>If it pleaſe your Lordſhip, I am ſo conuinced with the force of the truth of our religion, that it is impoſſible for me to leaue it: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in being of it do I you any iniury at all, but rather thereby an bound and obliged to ſerue you with more ſidelity.</hi> His Lord was ſo offended with this anſwere that he
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:6796:96"/>ſtroke him with his dagger, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, and meant to haue killed him with another blow, and had done ſo, had not ſome there held his hand, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers taken away the valerous Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of Chriſt, who there vpon his knees ſtayed expecting and deſiring it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. In the Citty of <hi>Firoxima</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were carried after a calmer ſort, by reaſon that <hi>Fucuxima Tayudono</hi> Lord thereof, and of the Kingdomes of <hi>Aqui</hi> and <hi>Bingo</hi> was a freind vnto the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and fauored the Fathers of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety very much, not only giuing them ample licence to make Chriſtians in his Country, but alſo (being a Gentill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) gaue them a houſe and place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to dwell, and part alſo of their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: and ſo by that meanes there were many worthy Chriſtians in his Countryes. But letting paſſe the fruit which thoſe of the Society did in thoſe and other neighbour Countries at that tyme. I will now only ſpeake of that

               <p n="13">13. In the beginning of February of the yeare 1614. <hi>Tayudono.</hi> being at the Court of <hi>Yendo,</hi> he wrote a very curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous letter vnto the Father that was ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour at <hi>Firoxima,</hi> ſaying that he was very ſory for their baniſhment, but now it could not be remedied being ſo ordeined by the <hi>Xogun,</hi> &amp; that he would be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of them. He alſo wrote vnto his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors that they ſhould ſend the Fathers withall courteſy to <hi>Nangaſaqui;</hi> and that as touching the Chriſtians they ſhould not medle with any but of the common ſort, and with thoſe only for comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and faſhion ſake. The <hi>Gentills</hi> there when they heard firſt the newes of the Fathers departure were very ſory for it, and came vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſignify how much it grieued them, for indeed they all did loue and eſteeme them very much: but therebeing no remedy, one of the Fathers with others of their houſe remayned there ſecretly, and the reſt departed to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:6796:98"/>
                  <hi>Nangaſaqui.</hi> The Gouernors tooke from the Chriſtians their beades, pictures and <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and put ſome of them into ſackes as thoſe of <hi>Meaco</hi> had beene, and afterwardes making relation to <hi>Tayudono</hi> of what they had done, and carring vnto him ſome of the Chriſtians beades, he ſaid that they had done to much, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the beades, <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and other thinges to be kept with reuerence as holy thinges.</p>
               <p n="13">13. This <hi>Tayudono</hi> is one of the Princes of moſt Fame in all <hi>Iapone,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table warriour and a man of great reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and courage in his buſineſſes: and becauſe he had emulatours in the Court, he wrote vnto foure of his Captaines that to giue contentment to the <hi>Xogun,</hi> he deſired them they would leaue their religion, and that therein they ſhould do him great ſeruice. They anſwered, <hi>that they deſired much to dye in his ſeruice, and that they were very ſorry that in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he demanded they could not giue him contentment. For that ſetting a ſide that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:6796:99"/>which was the principall (to wit their fayth to God, their Religion and Saluation) euen in morall honeſty and worldly honour, being ſo knowne for Christians as they were, they could not now pull backe their feet, but that it would be a baſe and diſhonorable thinge, and a ſigne of a falſe hart &amp; cowardly mind, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would any men of worth, if they ſhould goe from their fayth, euer afterward put any trust or confidence in them. That which they could and would do, was to be carefull whileſt they remayned with him in the Court not to make any exteriour ſhew of their being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, by which any hurt or damage might come vnto him: and that if this were not ſufficient, they, their wiues and children were prepard rather to dy then to do any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the profeſſion of their Fayth.</hi> It was thought that <hi>Tayudono</hi> would haue been much offended with this anſwere: but he did diſſemble the matter, rather eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them the more for it.</p>
               <p n="14">14. This Prince had a Chriſtian page, who was much moleſted by other pages to make ſome ſigne that he was no
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:6796:99"/>Chriſtian, and to this end they feigned that his Lord did ſend vnto him for his beades and <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> but he would not deliuer them by any meanes, wherewith they being much vexed to bring him into diſcredit with his Lord, they tould him how they had now drawne him to deny his faith. Within a few dayes after his Lord asked him if he were a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, becauſe it had beene tould him that now he was none: &amp; the page anſwered: <hi>My Lord I am a Chriſtian as you know, and haue beene all wayes from a chyld, and for all the world I will not leaue to be ſo. I do deſire to ſerue your Lordſhip in all you ſhall command me, but to deny Chriſt that way not be: and if for this cauſe your Lordſhip will cut of my head, heere I offer it very willingly;</hi> and with that he did vncouer his necke. All that were preſent thought aſſuredly his Lord would haue cut of his head, for that in ſuch occaſions many tymes he is not Mayſter of himſelfe: but yet at that time he did bridle his paſſion, &amp; prayſed his pages reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who by that meanes
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:6796:100"/>remayned with victory ouer the Diuell, and his other enemies, and was in more fauour with his Lord, and more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of then before.</p>

I will conclude this Chapter with two other thinges by which al may perceaue the conſtancy and feruour of the Chriſtians of this Kingdome of <hi>Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi> There was a worthy Souldier much importuned by his Lord, by meanes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons, that he would accomodate himſelfe vnto the tyme for the preſent, and becauſe he loued him very well and was loath to looſe ſo faythfull a ſeruant; ſeing others could not preuayle, he went himſelfe in perſon to perſwade him. The ſouldier vnderſtood thereof, and leauing behind him his ſword &amp; dagger (which otherwiſe they alwaies vſe to weare) he went out of his houſe to meet him, and ſaid: <hi>My Lord, I am reſolued not to leaue to be a Chriſtian, becauſe I hope in this religion to be ſaued. If your Lordſhip come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me the contrary, it will be but loſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6796:107"/>labour, and if you pleaſe you may cut off my head for it: and therewith all he held out his necke for him to cut it off.</hi> And he remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in that manner, a little ſonne of his of no more then nyne yeares ould, came out of the houſe and did the ſame that he ſaw his Father do, and after him his Mother and Grand-mother, with the ſelfe ſame reſolution: wherewith the Noble man was ſo aſtoniſhed that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were a Gentill and noted for his cruelty, yet did he fall a weeping, &amp; being ouercome with ſo great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy, returned backe vnto his houſe, though after ſome few daies for feare of the <hi>Xogun</hi> he commanded the valorous Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to depart out of his Country: to the which he willingly obeyed (ſory he had not obteyned the crowne of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) going himſelfe and all his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Nangaſaqui.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Another good Chriſtian called <hi>Titus,</hi> a ſubſtantiall man, was in like manner perſecuted by his Lord, who ſeeing his great conſtancy commanded

Within a while there came another me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſage vnto him from his Lord, that <hi>Martina</hi> was alſo put to a moſt cruell death, &amp; that if he were yet ſo inſenſible that with al this he would not be moued to obey, he ſhould ſend his other ſonne called <hi>Simon</hi> who was 16. yeares old, and after that he ſent for his wife called <hi>Marina:</hi> and the valorous Chriſtian ſent them all moſt willingly, ſaying that he had rather looſe wife, children, life and all then the grace of God, or leaue his religion: and his wife and children al of them went with great content to offer themſelues in ſacrifice. The Lord put euery one of them by themſelues a part, and then ſet vpon them, both with
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:6796:108"/>intreaties and with threates, but being not able to preuayle any thing at all with them, firſt they powred very could wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all ouer <hi>Marinas,</hi> body: to her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Martina</hi> they gaue no meate at all in three daies together, and <hi>Simon</hi> the elder ſonne they beat moſt cruelly, and wrong his handes behynd him; all of them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this perſeuering very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtill.

She anſwered, that ſhe had offered to God both her owne and her childrens liues, and ſo ſhe could not giue them any ſuch counſayle. They had conſiſcated <hi>Titus</hi> his goodes before all this happened, and for the finall reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Lord ſent him word by a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his owne, with armed men, that if he did not deſiſt from his obſtinate

               <p n="2">2. After the death of <hi>Simcon Condera, Chicuyendono</hi> his ſonne ſucceeded in the poſſeſſion of that Kingdome, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured the Fathers &amp; Chriſtians much, who were many, and ſome of them of noble parentage. And although he were much moleſted and ſollicited by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorites of the <hi>Xogun,</hi> and eſpecially by <hi>Saſioye</hi> that he ſhould not permit Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches nor Fathers in his country, yet did he ſtill winke at them during his vncle <hi>Sayemondono</hi> his life, who was alwaies a valerous defendour of the Fathers and Chriſtians. But after his death when the <hi>Xogun</hi> and his ſonne put the Chriſtians out of their houſes and ſeruice in the yeare 1612. he being much more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned then before, becauſe he would ſeeme to comply with them, and withall conſerue the Churches from being rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, he ſent word vnto the Fathers by

Within a ſhort tyme after aroſe the perſecution at <hi>Faca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> It was there proclaimed that all the Chriſtians ſhould come together to a certaine place before a Temple; whither being come they vrged them very much, and to terrify the Multitude with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a few, and ſhew themſelues punctuall and exact in performing the <hi>Xoguns</hi> command, they determined to vſe ſome rigour with <hi>Thomas Xozayemon</hi> and <hi>Ioachim Xinden,</hi> who were more forward then the reſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This <hi>Thomas</hi> was very feruorous in animating the Chriſtians with his exhortations &amp; example of pennance &amp;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:6796:111"/>mortification to perſeuerance in their faith, &amp; <hi>Ioachim</hi> for his vertue and good life was much knowne and beloued of all the principal perſons of the Country. He was a Father vnto the poore, and being a Phiſitian he cured them of almes. No diligence was left vndone to moue and make them accomodate themſelues vnto the tyme, but they anſwering that in no caſe they could do it, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſent to priſon, and there bound with cordes very ſtrait vnto two poſtes, but ſeeing that therewith they were not ouercome, <hi>Chicuyendono</hi> comanded that they ſhould be both of them hanged vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a certaine tree neere vnto <hi>Facata,</hi> and ſo left there vntyll they did deny their fayth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Vpon the 13. of March they did hange <hi>Ioachim</hi> vpon the tree, which was a very high Pyne, his feet vpward and his head hanging towards the ground. And in the ſame tree they did alſo hange <hi>Thomas</hi> in the ſame manner, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing below <hi>Ioachim;</hi> and being in that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:6796:112"/>terrible torment they did animate one the other with great ioy and alacrity. <hi>Remember Brother Thomas</hi> (ſayd <hi>Ioachim</hi>) <hi>that which our bleſſed Lord &amp; Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt did ſuffer for vs vpon the Croſſe, and let vs giue him thankes for this fauour that he ſheweth vs, in ſuffering ſomething to his imitation on a tree. And although wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy: yet in ſome reſpect wee do reſemble</hi> S. Peter, <hi>who was crucified with his head downeward. I was euen thinking ſo</hi> (ſayd Thomas) <hi>&amp; the conſideration thereof doth eaſe my paine which is nothing to that which I do deſire to ſuffer for Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The day following there was great concourſe of people to ſee them: &amp; ſome of the Gentills ſaying to <hi>Ioachim,</hi> that they wondered he would be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate as to ſuffer ſo great a torment for a thing ſo vncertaine as ſaluation is, after a while he a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered. <hi>I held my peace a while as being buſied with God, not much regarding men: but not to ſeeme diſcourteous, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may not thinke that we do repent our ſelues; I pray you tell me one thing: Thoſe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:6796:112"/>that haue receaued ſo many benefits, honours and fauours of</hi> Chicuyendono, <hi>as many of you that be preſent haue done, if they ſhould be brought to ſuch extremity, that eyther they muſt looſe their liues, or els bee diſloyall vnto him; would they not chooſe death and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer affliction els, rather then to be traytors vnto their Lord? How then can wee being Gods creatures, and hauing receaued ſo many benefitts of him as he hath beſtowed vpon vs, deny him now for all the tormentes that be, or can be inſlicted vpon vs?</hi> With this anſwere the auditors were al conuinced, and both Chriſtians and Pagans did commend it much.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Three dayes well nigh did thoſe two holy men remayne in that manner, hanging by the heeles, not hauing ſo much as one bit of meat or drop of water giuen them all that tyme. At the end thereof the Officers ſtill ſeeing them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſo conſtant as they were, did let them downe, and cauſed them to be faſt bound imediatly to a ladder, which had a peece of wood put through it in forme
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:6796:113"/>of a Croſſe. A Chriſtian asked them how they did: <hi>Ioachim</hi> anſwered: <hi>I ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffered much when I was a ſouldier, but ſuch paynes as at this tyme I neuer felt before, for it ſeemed to me that I was ſawed through all my body, but I conforted my ſelfe conſidering that al my tormentes were nothing compared to thoſe which Chriſt ſuffered for me: &amp; I did apply my paines to his in ſatiſfaction of my ſinnes. Chicuyendono</hi> ſeeing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and that with ſo prolonged and cruell a torment they could not be made to change their mindes, gaue order that they ſhould be beheaded: which ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence being giuen they were imediately taken &amp; carried to execution, to a place that was ſomething diſtant thence. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achim</hi> could not mooue himſelfe, and ſo he was carried thither vpon ſouldiers backes: and <hi>Thomas</hi> went on foot, both of them repleniſhed with ioy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. When they were come vnto the place, hauing prayed a little ſpace, the executioner out of their heades, they in the meane time often repeating the holy
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:6796:113"/>name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Their bodies and heades were conueyed to <hi>Nangaſaqui</hi> &amp; giuen to Father Prouincial of the Society of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Their holy death was a great encorage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Chriſtians, as their liues had alſo beene an example alwaies vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A <hi>Bonzo</hi> preaching in that Citty ſoone after their death ſaid in his Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thoſe of his ſect: Thoſe men queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leſſe were of great valour, &amp; there can be no doubt but that they are ſaued, ſeeing they ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much, and with ſo great quiet and contentment, for their faith.</p>
               <p n="9">9. When <hi>Michael Saymoendono</hi> was Lord of <hi>Aquizuqui,</hi> through his great zeale and feruour he was the occaſion that more then fiue thouſand of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, ſouldiers, and tenantes were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the ſpace of two yeares, by meanes of the Fathers of the Society. After his death the Eſtate was wholy changed, only the husbandmen and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people remayning therein, who were committed to the charge of an old <hi>Bonzo</hi> a great enemy of the Chriſtians.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:6796:114"/>He called them all vnto him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to write their names in a paper whether they would be Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or no, and finding that the moſt of them did ſubſcribe that they were Chriſtians, and would ſo continue, he was much troubled thereat, and publiquely gaue out that they meant to riſe in rebellion. Whereupon there came thither from the Caſtle of <hi>Fucuoca</hi> fiue Captaines with 300. ſouldiers, who although they ſaw euidently that the report was falſe, yet did they enter into their howſes, tooke away their beades, pictures, and other ſuch like thinges, which bare any ſhew of things belonging any way to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion; and not content there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſome they puniſhed with tortures, others they baniſhed, and therin though ſome ſhewed weaknes, feare and frailty, yet others, and the greateſt part, ſtood ſtedfaſt with notable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy; of which the Gentills would take no notice, but without all reaſon and examination of particulers did publiſh that they had all
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:6796:114"/>denied their fayth, and ſo they exerciſed their fury only vpon <hi>Matthias Xichirobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oye,</hi> who was one of the formeſt in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing that he was a Chriſtian, and as it ſeemeth ſoreſeeing that which would enſue, did therefore aſſoone as he retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home begin to prepare himſelf to dy for the ſame.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Vpon the 14. of March the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor ſent ſome vnto him to perſwade him not to be ſo obſtinate, nor to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate others to be diſobedient to their Superiours: and they entred into his houſe very violently, and by force tooke away his beades from him, the which grieued him very much for the preſent, he reputing it as great a diſgrace, as if they had taken his weapons from him: but after a little conſideration he ſayd vnto them: <hi>The Fayth of a Chriſtian doth not conſiſt in his beades nor pictures, but in the mind, &amp; in the conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t profeſſion thereof which by the grace and help of God, I meane to do before the Gouernor and Captaines, &amp; in part I haue done, as may bee ſeene by my

Let vs go, for with the helpe of God I ſhall go now where I ſhall not need to eat any more.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The Leiftenant aſked him if he had giuen his name that he was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and that he would not obey the <hi>Xogun?</hi> To which he anſwered reſolutely <hi>yes, and that he was in that mind still: and that they needed not to proceede further with him in more queſtions and demandes, for that hee would not change from that for all the goodes of the world.</hi> There they made him expect a while till they had examined ſome others, and then they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to <hi>Aquizuqui,</hi> where the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Captaines were: and in the way paſſing by an Idoll called <hi>Fachima</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:6796:115"/>which is the Idoll of Warre, they threw him downe vpon the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; beat him cruelly, perhapps becauſe hee would not worſhip it, putting a rope about his necke, and pulling it ſo hard that he was almoſt ſtrangled therewith, and could ſcarcely ſpeake, yet as well as he could he deſired them they would flacke it a little, that with better quiet and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend himſelfe to God in that little time he thought he had to liue: they anſwered him that ſeeing he had willfully put himſelfe therin, he muſt now haue patience: <hi>You ſay very well ſaid he, for ſince I ſuffer this for the loue of God, it is great reaſon I ſhould endure it patiently.</hi> Afterwardes they offered him to looſe the rope a little, but he would not, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Let me alone, for I deſire to ſuffer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Chriſt in this little remaynder of my life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Being brought before the Iudges they asked him why he was ſo ſtiffe and obſtinate in his opinion. He anſwered <hi>becauſe there is meanes of Saluation in the

I gaue my name vnto the Gouernour, that I am and alwaies will be a Christian, and if there be any other contrary to this, it is not myne but falſly forged. For that I haue neyther ſaid nor written any thing contrary to it, nor euer will de by the grace of God.</hi> Hereupon they thruſt him out of the roome with great diſgrace, and reuyled him excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, ſaying among other thinges, that a man ſo peruerſe and obſtinate as he, could not be a good ſubiect to his Prince, and ſo they adiudged him to death: and imediatly he was carried to the place of execution, whither he went
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:6796:116"/>praying all the way, and being come thither, he ſaid aloud that all might heare: <hi>I dye most willingly with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ioy for the fayth of Christ.</hi> Then he made a ſhort prayer, which being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they cut off his head.

               <p n="2">2. Some Gentills did perſwade him that the beſt meanes to make them yeald was to cauſe their wiues and daughters to be caried naked through the ſtreetes to their publike ſhame. And ſo it was determined, wherewith the Chriſtians were exceedingly troubled, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Some of them were of opinion that the beſt courſe in that occaſion was to ſhut vp all the women into houſes, and that the men ſhould keep them there and defend their honors with their liues, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then expoſe them to ſo vile and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a puniſhment: but after taking more mature aduice they ſent the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall perſons of the Confraternities vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to Prince to deſire him they might be puniſhed with the ordinary tormentes of baniſhment, beheading, crucifying, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

               <p n="3">3. Vpon this the execution was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and inſteed thereof it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that all thoſe that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere Chriſtians ſhould leaue the rentes they had. Whereupon imediately Fifty noble Gentlemen did leaue all that they had with great courage and alacrity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning poore without houſe, lands, or rents, or any reuenewes in the world.

They alſo ſent for a Father of the Society to come vnto <hi>Arima,</hi> who there in a very few dayes didheare the Confeſſions of more then 800. perſons ſecretly: and which is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of noting, the very Children (the eldeſt amongſt them not being fifteene yeares of age) had there made amongſt themſelues a Confraternity in the honor of <hi>S.

To this ſpeach of <hi>Safioye</hi> one of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans there preſent anſwered in the name of all the reſt: <hi>My Lord, we need not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider nor conſult concerning this Matter, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that long ago we haue beene reſolued therein. As concerning the conſeruation of Arimadono his eſtate, it dependeth not vpon our being, or not being Christians, for that being ſo, we ſhall be both more faythfull and more obedient vnto him then otherwiſe. And
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:6796:119"/>as we awayes haue beene to his Father Don Iohn, ſo will we be to him, ready to ſerue him both with our goodes and liues. But as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe thinges which touch the ſaluation &amp; good of our owne ſoules, there is no reaſon that any force or violence ſhould be offered vnto vs. If it be the pleaſure of Superiour powers to take away Arimadono his estate from him becauſe we be Christians, we ſhall be very ſory for it, but haue no fault at all therein, for we cannot put in hazard the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of our ſoules, which is for euer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, for an eſtate or life that is ſo ſhort and brittle, and ſo ſoone to haue an end as this.</hi>

For whereas he hoped with the forſayd deuiſes to haue gotten a better Eſtate then that which he had before, now he found that it fell out cleane otherwiſe (and it was Godes puniſhment vpon him for his cruelty againſt the Chriſtians) for he loſt his old eſtate which was very good, and the ſubiects thereof very truſty and faythfull vnto him, and that which was giuen him was nothing ſo but very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and euen in the middeſt of all his enemies.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This change and the many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which happened vnto him in his iorney both by ſea and land, looſing ſome ſhipps with a great quantity of his goodes, and ſome of his ſeruantes alſo (thoſe only that were Gentills periſhing, and thoſe that were Chriſtians eſcaping) encouraged them very much, ſeeing how manifeſtly God Almighty began
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:6796:121"/>to puniſh his Infidelity, and that the meanes which he tooke to conſerue his eſtate, was the principall to ouerthrow it: and that he by whoſe counſell he had done ſo great miſchiefe and wickednes (to wit <hi>Safioyedono</hi>) ſhould be the man that wrought his vtter vndoing and perdition.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The Kingdome of <hi>Biyen</hi> and a good part of that of <hi>Bungo</hi> doth at the preſent belong to <hi>Nangaou Yetchudono</hi> one of the moſt noble and wiſe Princes of <hi>Iapone,</hi> who although a Gentill, yet was very well affected to the Fathers of the Society, to whome he and his ſonne <hi>Naiquidono</hi> gaue a houſe and ſcituation many yeares ago in their Citties of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zura</hi> and <hi>Nagatzu,</hi> &amp; alſo leaue to preach and make as many Chriſtians as they could, by which meanes there were many noble Chriſtians in his Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. He was many tymes himſelfe very neere being a Chriſtian at the perſwaſion of <hi>Don Iusto</hi> whoſe moſt inward freind he was. And although he was not ſo happy
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:6796:122"/>as to obteyne it, yet his wife <hi>Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na Gratia</hi> did, as may be ſeene in the 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the ſecond booke of the Hiſtory of <hi>Iapone.</hi> This Lady who was the daughter of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eco Aquehi,</hi> a great Lord that killed the famous <hi>Nobunanga,</hi> was very wiſe and of an excellent wit, and deſired very much to heare the reaſons and grounds of Chriſtian Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, much moued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with that which her husband <hi>Yetchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dono</hi> had related vnto her thereof; but it was impoſſible that any man ſhould get into her pallace, nor for her to go out to that effect, by reaſon that the noble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes of <hi>Iapone</hi> be very cloſely kept in, &amp; her husband was more rigorous in this point then any other.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Yet ſo it happened afterward that <hi>Taycoſama</hi> togeather with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and all the Princes of <hi>Iapone</hi> being in the warres of <hi>Satzuma,</hi> in the yeare 1587. ſhe found meanes to go out of her houſe to ſee the Temples of the Gentills of <hi>Ozaca,</hi> and from thence ſhe went ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and diſguiſed with many of her
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:6796:122"/>women to the Church of the Fathers of the Society that was in that Citty. She tooke great pleaſure, and particuler con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to ſee it: and asking many doubtes and queſtions by meanes of her ſeruantes (becauſe ſhe would not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer her ſelfe) about the Sects of <hi>Iapone,</hi> &amp; concerning Chriſtian religion, ſhe not only remayned very well ſatisfied, but alſo exceeding deſirous to heare the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Catechiſme: and becauſe ſhe had no other meanes, ſhe ſent euery day ſome of the beſt intelligent &amp; more ancient of her women vnto the Church, who hearing the Sermons did relate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto her in the beſt manner that they could. All the doubtes, difficulties, &amp; arguments that offered themſelues vnto her againſt thoſe thinges of Chriſtian religion ſhe heard, ſhe put downe ſtill in writing to know the ſolution therof, and being fully ſatisfied at length in all matters, God Almighty giuing her an extraordinary light in the myſteries of our fayth, ſhe was baptized by a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:6796:123"/>Gentlewoman (becauſe it could not poſſibly be done otherwiſe) that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon her, with wonderous content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her ſoule, great aboundance of deuotion, and extraordinary plenty of comfortable teares. And although ſhe neuer had any Prieſt or other religious perſon to giue her inſtructions, yet did God Almighty togeather with her Name communicate ſpeciall grace vnto her: Her deuotion, patience, and humylity, was extraordinary, euidently appearing in all her actions, and ſeene in her letter; and meſſages.</p>
               <p n="13">13. To the end ſhe might write vpon occaſion vnto the Fathers about her ſoules affayres, and vnderſtand their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſhe ſecretly learned without the teaching of any both to read and writ af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our manner of <hi>Europe,</hi> much differing from theirs. She cauſed ſome of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alſo to be baptized, and fifteene or more of her women and maydes, for which ſhe receaued ſom vnkindnes ather husbands hands: who yet when after her

And although he were much moleſted by the <hi>Xogun</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorites, and of the <hi>Bonzi,</hi> who neuer left intreating him to haue no Churches nor the Fathers in his Country: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was he moued, nor would giue any eare vnto them, vntill the yeare 1611. in which <hi>Father Gregory Ceſpules</hi> whome he loued and eſteemed very much departed out of this life. For then vpon his death he tooke occaſion to deliuer himſelfe from the importunities of the <hi>Xogun</hi> &amp; his fauorites, and ſo he then wiſhed the Fathers that they would go vnto <hi>Nanga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaqui,</hi> whither he ſent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wood of their Houſes and Churches, not doing the leaſt hurt or domage in the world vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="14">14. When in the yeare 1614. he
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:6796:124"/>vnderſtood how <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> his great freind had left and loſt his eſtate for his fayth &amp; religion he comended him very much for it, and ſaid: If <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> had not done in this occaſion as he hath done, he ſhould haue blemiſhed all the noble actions of his life. For a magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous man both in proſperity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity ought ſtill to be the ſame without any chang or mutation at all.</p>
               <p n="15">15. He ſent diuers tymes vnto <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſaqui</hi> to viſit him: and vnto a Father of the Society with whome he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, he ſignified that he was very ſory for the <hi>Xoguns</hi> manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges: and that Father ſending vnto him a treatiſe in which were anſwered the falſe calumniatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s made againſt the Chriſtian religion by the enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he anſwered that he was well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all thoſe thinges, but that it was neceſſary to haue patience for a tyme. Notwithſtanding all this to giue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to the <hi>Xogun,</hi> he commanded that in his Country the common people
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:6796:124"/>ſhould be examined as they were in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, among which there were ſome that ſhewed not ſuch conſtancy as they ought to haue done.

               <p n="2">2. When the newes of this perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:6796:125"/>came vnto <hi>Ximadono,</hi> he being then in the Kingdome of <hi>Fixen,</hi> where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he makes his aboad, he wrote preſently vnto the Fathers, that he was very ſory to heare of that new order made by the <hi>Xogun,</hi> but that he could not chooſe but be obedient thereunto, and that therefore he deſired they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his country vntill they ſaw what would be the end thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereupon they al departed ſoone after to the griefe of the Chriſtians, yea and of the Gentills alſo who did loue them very much. But becauſe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould not remayne without all comfort, although none of the Fathers could remayne amongſt them, yet did they leaue with them a good old man called <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the Porter of their houſe, and becauſe he had a ſonne that dwelt there in the towne of <hi>Xiqui,</hi> could with better colour ſtay.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Ximadono</hi> ſent word vnto his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours that he went vnto the Court, and that from thence he would write what ſhould be done with the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: but being in the way aduertiſed how ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly they were dealt withall in <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> he wrote againe vnto <hi>Xiroyemondone</hi> his principall gouernor of thoſe Ilandes, and to the reſt, that they ſhould not leaue one Chriſtian in them vnder paine of looſing their eſtates, yea and their liues alſo, for that the <hi>Xogun</hi> had ſo comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it. The Gouernour vſed great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the buſines, and after ſome tyme ſignified vnto <hi>Ximadono,</hi> that there were now no Chriſtians in the Ilands, which he did (it being moſt falſe) becauſe he bare no hatred but rather good affection towardes them, &amp; thought therby to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Adam</hi> the good old man in the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:6796:126"/>meane tyme went vp and downe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Chriſtians in their howſes, and animating them. The Gouernour hauing intelligence thereof, gaue command he ſhould be taken, &amp; that diligence ſhould be vſed to perſwade him to forſake his Fayth. He hearing of it, lifted vp his handes to heauen, gaue many thankes to God, and would not abſent himſelfe as ſome aduiſed him, but went directly to his ſones houſe, there to expect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, hoping for it afterwards to haue a crowne in heauen. Thither came many Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tills that were his freinds, to perſwade him al they could, but he with corage of mind did a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwere them in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner. <hi>Are you not aſhamed to perſwade me to ſo baſe a thinge for a man of my age, and that haue beene ſo many yeares a Chriſtian? Although it were only for worldly reſpect, I cannot now go backe, hauing ſerued the Fathers ſo many yeares, &amp; receaued ſo many benefitts at their handes: and I do remayne heere to do my leſt endeauour that the reſt of the Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne constant in their faith, how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I leaue
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:6796:127"/>it my ſelfe? Tell them that ſent you, and ſet you on worke, that in this only buſines I muſt neyther regard the Gouernour, nor</hi> Ximado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, <hi>nor the</hi> Xogun <hi>himſelfe, but only God Almighty, who is my Lord and Sauiour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſame perſwaſions were made him by all the officers, but he being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all moued there with, nor ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming much to regard them, they tooke and carried him priſoner vnto the Caſtle vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Thurſday before the holy Week, wherewith he ſeemed exceeding glad, becauſe he ſaid it was ſo neere the tyme of the paſſion of his Sauiour and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The Gouernour commanded that they ſhould put him all that night in the priſon, and in ſome paine, to ſee if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall he would be brought to change his determination: but ſeeing in the morning no change at all in him, he ſent for him, &amp; in preſence of other Gentills he ſayd vnto him: <hi>Adam,</hi> you knowe well inough the great loue that I alwaies did beare vnto the Fathers, and that I beare no euill will vnto your religion:
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:6796:127"/>but it is the <hi>Xoguns</hi> command, and <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madono</hi> hath ſignified vnto me, that he will make me be put to death, if I ſuffer ſo much as one only Chriſtian to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in his Country: let me intreat you therefore you would diſſemble a little for the preſent, and not to go ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the reſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Of your loue to the Fathers</hi> (ſaid Adam) <hi>I am a good witneſſe, and they I know will neuer ceaſe to be thankefull for it. But in this matter, ſeeing it is a thing that doth concerne the ſaluation of my ſoule, I cannot bee obedient to you therein. Your worſhip ſayth, that you perſecute the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt your will, only becauſe you would not looſe your eſtate and life; and I becauſe I would not looſe the eſtate of euerlasting life am determined to perſeuer vnto death in the faith of Christ. If I for obeying you ſhould be damned to the eternall torments of hell fire, neyther your Worſhip, nor the</hi> Xogun <hi>with al his power could deliuer me from them; &amp; although yee could, yet haue I receaued ſo many benefites of my Lord &amp; Sauiour Ieſus

Your Worſhip therefore may do with me as you pleaſe, for neyther will I my ſelfe leaue my religion, nor yet perſwade any other to do it.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. The Gouernour being much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffended with this anſwere, commanded him to be ſtripped naked: and the good old man glad to ſee ſo good a beginning, and giuing thankes to Almighty God for it, did help himſelfe to pul of his cloaths, which being done they bound him with cordes, and carried him in that manner through the ſtreets to his publique ſhame commanding that all ſhould come out of their houſes to looke &amp; gaze vpon him, which being done they left him bound in the ſtreet vntil ſuch tyme as they had ſet vp two thick poſtes ech of them of a fadom high diſtant foure or fiue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadths one from the other, and put another peece of wood through them both, and aboue it a rope. To theſe two poſtes they tyed his handes and feet
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:6796:128"/>in forme of a Croſſe with ſo great rigour that the tops of his toes did ſcarce touch the ground. In this manner he remayned from Friday before Palme ſunday vntill holy Saturday with was Eaſter Eue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though leaſt he ſhould dy with the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, and the Chriſtians reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him as a Martyr, they tooke him thence in the night tyme, as alſo when it rayned or ſnowed more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ordinary. It was a ſtrange thing that he being 63. yeares old &amp; newly recouered of a great ſickneſſe though he ſtood there naked all that tyme expoſed to the cold which was exceeding great, yet did he neuer make any ſhew or ſigne of feeling any greiſe at all.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A Father of the Society that had beene baniſhed from thence, and was now retourned againe ſecretly, to viſit the Chriſtians, ſent vnto him to animate him in his tormentes, and he anſwered. <hi>Tell the Father that I am of very good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, deſire him to commend me vnto God in his prayers, and that ſince I haue beene put
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:6796:129"/>heere in this torment I felt nothing at all of my ſicknes and infirmity.</hi> Many and great perſwaſions were vſed vnto him all this tyme. One ſayd vnto him: <hi>Adam,</hi> verily I cannot imagine in what you put your hope to be ſo obſtinate, for it is reported as moſt certaine that neither any Church ſhall ſtand, nor Father ſtay in all <hi>Iapone. If my hope ſaid he were placed in theſe things your newes would trouble me, ſuppoſe they were certaine, as I thinke they be not: but it is not placed in them, but in Almighty God who is in all places, and not ſubiect to muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and I hope in him that if they do caſt downe the Churches, and baniſh the Fathers; yet will he when it pleaſeth him, build them vp a new, and bring the Fathers backe againe to</hi> Iapone. <hi>Of this good Lord I hope to haue ſtrength to endure my toments, and to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto the end, and afterwards to be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully rewarded by him for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. When they were moſt buſy with him to perſwade him, he looked ſtill to heauen, and offered vp his prayers: and it ſeemed that ſometymes he was as it
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:6796:129"/>were in extaſy, the very poſition of his body much mouing thoſe that beheld him to deuotion. He was bound in the manner of a <hi>S. Andrews</hi> Croſſe, and his armes being tyed by the elbowes, hee fifted vp his handes (togeather with his eyes) to heauen, but could not make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to meet. He ſpake vnto the Chriſtians ſtill with great loue and affection, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating them, and deſiring them to pray for him vnto God. If they asked of him that he would pray for them in heauen, he did humble himſelfe ſaying, <hi>that he was a ſinner &amp; not worthy of ſo great a good.</hi> After this they carried him vnto another place that was both more publique and more cold, with intention to diſgrace &amp; torment him more. But he ſtill remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſame man, without any change at all. Vpon holy Saturday or Eaſter eue, becauſe they feared the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s would be to much encouraged with his exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, they looſed him from the tormenting place, and put him in the houſe of a Chriſtian, a freind of his, who did enter
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:6796:130"/>into band to deliuer him whenſoeuer they ſhould aske for him, &amp; ſo he ſtaied in that houſe two monthes without any keeper at all.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Three other Chriſtians were tyed at the ſame time, and in the ſame place with <hi>Adam,</hi> but they were not ſtripped naked as he was, nor yet ſtayed ſo long in the torment as he did, for that their kinred and freinds did promiſe the Gouernour that they would make them deny their fayth, although vnto them they ſayd nothing els, but only that they had obteined licence for them to liue as Chriſtians. The Gouernour was much delighted with this deceitfull deuiſe, &amp; greatly deſired the ſame tricke, might be put vpon <hi>Adam:</hi> but he was ſo careful of himſelfe that they could not poſſibly do it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The two monethes he remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his freindes houſe after he was taken from the torment, he liued a moſt holy life, ſpending all his tyme in a little Chamber there about a fadome ſquare,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:6796:130"/>eyther talking with the Chriſtians, that came thither, of ſpirituall matters, or els in prayer or reading the booke of the imitation of Chriſt. He neuer went out from thence vnleſſe it were in the night to bury ſome dead body. With the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills that came with purpoſe to peruert him he vſed ſuch kind of ſpeaches and behauiour that they did not long moleſt and trouble him. The Gouernour ſent him word that he was determined to cauſe his fingers and his toes to be cut off, not in that manner that the payne thereof ſhould make him dye, as he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do, but one by one, at ſeuerall tymes and dayes, to torment him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the more: to which he anſwered, <hi>I am ready, willing, and prepared to ſuffer thoſe tormentes you ſpeake of and greater to, &amp; I hope in God that he wil giue me ſtrength for all. If I dy in them, my lot ſhall be the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, and my ioy the greater: and if not, yet to haue ſuffered them will be ſome ſatisfaction for my ſinnes. Only this I deſire, that if it be reſolued on as you ſay it is, that they would
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:6796:131"/>begin to execute it preſently, for being an old man as I am, I do deſire before I dye to haue ſome part of the merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. The Gouernour with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere was aſtoniſhed, &amp; in a rage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they ſhould begin the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it preſently. But his man fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome puniſhment from heauen if ſo cruell a torment ſhould haue beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon the innocent &amp; holy man, he cauſed it to be differred vntil another tyme. After that <hi>Adam</hi> had giuen this anſwere vnto the Gouernour he felt in himſelfe extraordinary ioy, with many heauenly comfortes and celeſtiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations. And as he tould a certaine friend of his in great ſecrecy, he ſaw one tyme our Bleſſed Lady the moſt happy mother of our Sauiour Chriſt with a Croſſe in her hand, by which he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that he ſhould obtayne the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crowne of Martyrdome. And whereas before this tyme he could not endure to heare others ſay that he ſhould be a Martyr, holding himſelfe for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:6796:131"/>thereof: euer after this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted very much to heare and ſpeake of it. That he had other heauenly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beſides this, might be alſo gathered by his wordes, though through humility he neuer would declare them vnto any.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The Gouernour afterwardes vſed meanes that <hi>Adam</hi> might ſecretly eſcape, and go vnto <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> and he hauing notice thereof ſaid: <hi>What fly? in no caſe I. If they will baniſh me, giuing me a note vnder their handes, that hauing ſo long tyme perſwaded me that I ſhould leaue the fayth of Chriſt, yet I would not, and that therefore they do haniſh me, then will I goe, and not otherwiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. The Gouernour durſt not giue him ſuch a note, but differred the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which was giuen of cutting of his toes and fingers by little and little, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him naked through all the Ilandes for an example to all Chraſtians vntill he had conſulted the matter with the reſt of <hi>Ximadono</hi> his Gouernours: which when he had done, and had related vnto them
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:6796:132"/>the whole diſcourſe, they all anſwered, that it would be a great diſcredit both vnto him and <hi>Ximadon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> alſo, if ſo rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and obſtinate a fellow as they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, were not ſeuerely puniſhed: that the ſentence of death ſhould be noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vnto him, and if he did not change his minde, alſo executed. Hereupon immediatly they notified vnto <hi>Adam</hi> the ſentence, wherwith he receiued no ſmall comfort. And it being publiſhed in the Country thereaboutes, there came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo great a multitude of Chriſtians to be preſent at his martyrdome, that they durſt not put him to death publiquely, leaſt they ſhould take his body for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques. They caried him therefore bound vnto the Caſtle, giuing out that this death ſhould be very publique after ſome foure or fiue dayes.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The Chriſtians vſed all meanes poſſible, for ſome of them at the leaſt, to haue beene preſent at his death: but it could not be, for one night very ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly they tooke him out of the Caſtle and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:6796:132"/>carried him to the place of Martyrdome, whither he went with great ioy and alacrity, although the way was very rugged, and the night exceeding darke, and they had no torches nor other light at all, becauſe of going with more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy: and whereas ſome of the company ſtumbled almoſt at euery ſtep, yet did he go with ſuch agility and nimblenes, that he was euer the foremoſt of them all. Being come vnto the place he kneeled downe vpon his knees, prayed moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly, and at two blowes had his head ſtroken off. For it being ſo darke a night that the executioner could not ſee, he gaue the firſt blow vpon his ſhoulders, at the which he neuer ſo much as moued, but quietly expected the ſecond, twice inuoking aloud the bleſſed name of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> And the Gentills themſelues did teſtify that after his head was fallen downe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ground, he named twice more that moſt holy Name, ſo loud, that it might haue beene heard through all the valley, whereat they wondering ſaid:
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:6796:133"/>
                  <hi>That only to haue ſeene the conſtancy and ioy wherewithall Adam dyed, were motiue i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to moue any man to be a Christian: &amp; that it was not poſſible, but that one dying ſo as he did ſhould be ſaued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. They tooke his holy body and trayled it vnto the Sea ſhoare, and there wrapping it togeather with his head in a net, tying ſtones vnto it to make it ſinke, they caſt it into the Sea, becauſe the Chriſtians ſhould not find it, &amp; ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence any of his reliques.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Though this Martyrdome were done ſo ſecretly, as I haue ſaid, yet did the Chriſtians ſuſpect it, and thereupon ſome of them went vnto the place where it was done, but they found there only ſome little quantity of his freſh bloud, the which with part of his apparel they tooke with great deuotion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with all ſpeed poſſible, becauſe the Gentills were now comming backe againe thither to couer the bloud, to the end to ſigne at all ſhould remaine of his Martyrdome. The Chriſtians of <hi>Xiqui,</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:6796:133"/>and other places vſed great diligence with nets and hooks, and other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to haue found and taken vp his holy body: and there was a Spaniard that offered 500. Ducates to any one that could bring it him, but it could not poſſibly be found.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Diuers Chriſtians did affirme, that for many dayes togeather there was ſeene a great brightnes ouer the place where this holy ſeruant of God was put to death, as alſo ouer that place of the Sea wherein his body was caſt, the which is ſo certaine, ſo many Chriſtians ſeeing it altogether, ſometymes fourty, ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>etymes fifty, ſometymes more, notonce nor twice but often tymes, that there can be made no doubt thereof. Some there were that would not beleeue it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe themſelues did not ſee it with the reſt, which yet afterwardes hauing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelues by prayer to that end, did moſt cleerly &amp; euidently ſee and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it.</p>
               <p n="20">. Many notable thinges might be
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:6796:134"/>related of this holy man, but omitting all the reſt I will only ſet downe two which in my opinion ſeeme very worthy of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. An ancient Chriſtian thinking in his hart within himſelfe what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes might be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him which might make him wauer in the profeſſion of his faith, and all ſeeming very eaſy to him to endure, only the thought that ſeauen younge Children which he had ſhould be tormented before his face, and that his wife ſhould be carried through the ſtreets to publique ſhame, did terrify him exceeding much, and make him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wauer in his mind. All this paſſed in his hart within himſelfe, not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it one word at all to any one aliue. This man afterwards went to viſit <hi>Adam</hi> when he was in priſon, who ſeeing him ſaid: <hi>What an impreſſion did the imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your wiues publique ſhame, and your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens tormenting make in you? O what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt is this! Be not afrayd, for he that giues courage for one thinge will giue alſo for the rest.</hi> The man was aſtoniſhed when he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:6796:134"/>perceaued that <hi>Adam</hi> had ſeene and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that which he only thought within himſelfe, and was encouraged thereby to confeſſe his faith, and ſuffer for it all that ſhould be offered.</p>
               <p n="21">. Another man being ouercome by faire words and intreaties, did ſhew ſome frailty in the confeſſion of his fayth, who going afterwardes to viſit <hi>Adam,</hi> he reprehended him very ſharply for it, but after he was gone from thence <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid vnto thoſe that were preſent: <hi>This man being importunated did ſhew ſome frailty, but he will ſtoutly stand heere after for the honour of God.</hi> And ſo it happened indeed, for he repenting himſelfe of his fault, and very ſory for it, went to one of the Officers who had beene the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſinne, and in his houſe in the preſence of diuers Gentills ſaid vnto him: <hi>Sir you remember well the meanes you vſed with me to make me leaue the faith of Christ, and I moued with your intreaties did ſhew my ſelfe vnconſtant and cowardly: But in very truth did not leaue to be a Chriſtian,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:6796:135"/>nor to ſay my beades: and now euery night I do diſcipline my ſelfe for the ſinne I then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. I do deſire you very earneſtly you would hould me for a Chriſtian, and to ſignify the ſame to all that haue had notice of my fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">. The Gentill was much often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to heare him ſpeake in that manner, as alſo the reſt that were preſent, ſaying, that, that which he deſired could neither be granted nor permitted being contrary to the <hi>Xoguns</hi> comand. To which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that at leaſt they would let him haue his beades and pictures publiquely: they being very angry thruſt him out of the roome diſgracfully, with many thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atning ſpeaches. But he to ſhew that he neither was affraid of them, nor aſhamed to be accounted a Chriſtan, went ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly into the Kitchen of the houſe, and taking vp a hoat burning Iron that was there, he made therewith a great Croſſe in his forehead, burning his fleſh excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and ſo returning to the place where the Gentills were, he ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:6796:135"/>
                  <hi>My Maisters now that I haue made this ſign of the holy Croſſe in my forehead, no man can doubt but that I am a Christian: well may you giue me all the torments that you pleaſe, for I hope in God ſince he hath giuen me ſtrength to do this, he will alſo giue me courage to ſuffer whatſoeuer elſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. The Gouernour afterward had notice of this action, and determined to haue puniſhed him ſeuerely for it, but others diſſwaded him ſaying, that with the example of <hi>Adam</hi> and of this man there would be many more that would offer themſelues to martyrdome, if he did deale any further therein. Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he diſſembled the matter, and the good Chriſtian who remained marked for al his life, did ſay that after he heard <hi>Adams</hi> words he could neuer be quiet in mind vntill he had made this Confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Fayth, and with his example ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated all the other Chiſtians to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and couragious.</p>
               <p n="24">24. The Fathers of the Society were alſo baniſhed out of the Country
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:6796:136"/>of <hi>Conzura,</hi> although the Gouernour there was not ſo rigorous in his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings as in ſome other places, for that he did not imediatly ſet vpon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but after ſome tyme, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make a ſhew that he had ſome reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect vnto the <hi>Xoguns</hi> order. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded firſt of all, ſix good Chriſtians who had the care and cuſtody of ſix Churches committed vnto them, as alſo to animate the reſt of the Chriſtians in the Fathers abſence to depart the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: then he baniſhed eleuen or twelue ouer Chriſtians that had beene baniſhed out of other kingdomes for their fayth, and were retyred thither to haue meanes to liue neere to the Church: ſo that one with another there were baniſhed out of that Country ſome two hundred and fifty Chriſtians, all very ioyfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſee themſelues ſo often baniſhed, ſo toſſed and turmoyled for the fayth of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="25">25. After this they gaue out that they would carry all the women, that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:6796:136"/>would not leaue to be Chriſtians, through all the townes naked to their publike ſhame; the which did cauſe in them all great feare and trouble. But one among the reſt, a woman of good eſtate, did animate them all, ſaying: <hi>That it were not much for them to paſſe that ſhame for Chriſt, ſeeing he had ſuffered the ſame for them, and that ſhe was ready and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be carried ſo through all the townes and Citties of Iapone, rather then once to offend Almighty God.</hi> With this the reſt were much encouraged, and ſo they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gouernour comming a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the ſtreetes with armed men, all of them that could did go together to one place animating one another to dye for their Religion. But the gentills meaning only to make a demonſtration that they did obey the <hi>Xoguns</hi> Command, and to haue ſome colour afterwardes to giue out that now there were no Chriſtians in the Country, they went only vnto ſome few poore perſons that were without the towne, &amp; perſwading them to ſubſcribe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:6796:137"/>according to their pleaſure, they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with great triumph, publiſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad that now all had left the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chriſtian fayth. Whereupon they caſt downe the Churches, and cut downe all the Croſſes; but the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſet vp one again on a mountaine not farr of from the towne, whither they went to pray at ſundry tymes, and do their diſciplines. The like happened to the Chriſtians of <hi>Oyano,</hi> which is another Iland neere adioyning thereto, ſome of them being very much abuſed, others baniſhed for their fayth.</p>

               <p>HAVINGE related that which happened in other Kingdomes, it remayneth now that we ſpeak a little of ſuch thinges as paſſed at this
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:6796:137"/>tyme in the Citty of <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> and in other townes neere adioyning thereto. The Fathers of the Society had fiue or ſix Houſes in the Kingdome of <hi>Fixen,</hi> beſides thoſe which they had in <hi>Nangaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,</hi> and beſides diuers other Chappells which they often viſited. The firſt was in <hi>Iſafay,</hi> where the Lord or Prince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Gentill being a freind vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did deſire to conſerue the Churches and Chriſtians in peace and quietnes: yet for feare of the <hi>Xogun,</hi> he comanded firſt that the Church of <hi>Iſafay</hi> ſhould be taken downe, leauing the other houſes ſtanding as they were, and that the Churches of the villages ſhould be ſo diſguiſed that they ſhould not ſeeme to be that which they were: yet he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Father to come and viſit the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſecretly. A little after this he made a Proclamation, in which he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that all ſhould leaue to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as the <hi>Xogun</hi> had ordained, but yet vnder hand he gaue order that in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no rigour ſhould be vſed, although
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:6796:138"/>ſome Noble men his ſubiectes moued eyther with hatred towards the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, or with that they ſaw practiſed in other places, did very much perſecute their ſeruantes, who thereby manifeſted their Conſtancy, and defire to dy for their Religion, ſome of them ſuffering baniſhment, and looſing therby al that which they had, others being ready to do the ſame, were permitted for a tyme and winked at.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Fathers had another howſe in <hi>Fudoyama,</hi> from whence they did vſe to viſit part of the eſtate of <hi>Omura</hi> and other Territories thereabout. The <hi>Bonzi</hi> of <hi>Omura</hi> did make earneſt ſuite vnto the Prince, that he would compell his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to imbrace their ſect, and leaue the faith of Chriſt: but he made anſwere vnto them, that for religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſake he would not depriue himſelfe of his ancient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes; telling them moreouer, that if they were ſo certaine that their ſect was good and true, they ſhould conuince the Chriſtians with their reaſons, and not
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:6796:138"/>compell them by force. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to giue them ſome content, he made a law that whoſoeuer did receaue any of the Fathers into his houſe ſhould incurre the forfeyture of a certaine ſome of money, but they for all that neyther left to intertaine them, nor yet to ſeeke and make inquiry after them. <hi>Ximadono</hi> vſed more extremity, for that he ſeized vpon the goodes and landes of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of <hi>Caratzu,</hi> baniſhing them out of his Countries. And one among the reſt who in that occaſion left all he had with great courage and content was <hi>George Acaſioye,</hi> of whoſe notable fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and glorious death we ſhall make mention in the 10.

In this Countrey there was a Chriſtian to whoſe care the keeping was committed of a Church and the thinges therein, and certaine Gentills intending by force to take a picture out of it, he tould them couragiouſly, that he would ſooner looſe his head, then let it go. They durſt not kill him without order from the Prince, who at that tyme was fart off, &amp; on the other ſyde they feared leaſt he would fly away before the anſwere came. The which when he vnderſtood he bouldly went vnto them, and ſaid. <hi>Go aske the Prince what his pleaſure is to haue done with me, and I will ſtay here till you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. If I fly you ſhall vnderstand thereby that I leaue to be a Chriſtian, which is that which you deſire.</hi> There he remayned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a good while; at length the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence came that they ſhould take all he had from him, and put him out of the Country, and ſo it was put in execution, and he taking with him the picture went to <hi>Nangaſaqui</hi> more contented in his owne mind, then if he had carried with

The third &amp; fourth houſes which the Fathers had in this Kingdome were in <hi>Vracami,</hi> and <hi>Mongui,</hi> in which places becauſe they were ſo neere to <hi>Nangaſaqui</hi> there was no other thing done, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preparations made for the generall aſſault which all did expect would ſoone after follow. Their fifth Houſe was in <hi>Fucafori,</hi> where there was more copious and glorious fruit. This towne is ſubiect to the Lord of <hi>Fixen,</hi> and ſtandeth at the entrance of the Port or Hauen of <hi>Nangaſaqui.</hi> When <hi>Safioyedono</hi> was made Gouernor of <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> he being very zealous in the ſuperſtitious religion of the Gentills, and hauing no place within the Citty where to vſe his Heatheniſh rites (all being there Chriſtians) he cauſed a little temple (which they call <hi>Mia</hi>) to be made in <hi>Fucafori,</hi> whither he went to that purpoſe as often as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was required. It greeued him very much, to ſee a Church of the Chriſtians
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:6796:140"/>there, and he ſo contriued the matter that the yeare laſt paſt it was caſt downe without any other domage done vnto the Chriſtians: but now vpon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he cauſed a Proclamation to be made that all ſhould leaue their fayth vnder great paines &amp; forfeytures: to the which the Chriſtians all with one accord anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, that although it coſt them their liues they would not do it. Whereupon the Gouernour ſending for the Chiefe of them, gaue them very bad ſpeaches, calling them fooles &amp; Aſſes, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as following the Sectes of <hi>Iapone,</hi> they might ſaue their ſoules and ioyntly liue in pleaſure, proſperity, and content: yet they would rather follow a hard Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, taught only by a few ſtrangers, &amp; that with danger to looſe their goodes and liues, and the liberty of their wiues and Children.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To the which one of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in name of the reſt anſwered in this manner: <hi>My Lord, the reaſon why we imbrace and follow the fayth of Chriſt, is
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:6796:140"/>becauſe it is manifeſt vnto vs, that in it only we can be ſaued and not in any of the ſectes of Iapone, which be both very different and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing among themſelues, and all of them without any ſolid ground and true foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And in matters concerning the gayning or looſing of eternall life, it were no wiſdome, but plaine folloy, to haue too much regard to the loſſe of temporall goodes, as all thinges in this world be.</hi> The Gouernour replyed, aſking him, If he had euer ſeen or ſpoken with any poſt, or other meſſenger that came from the other world, and brought newes of another life. <hi>The reaſons my Lord</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>are ſo euident, that there is another life, and the teſtimonies and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes that our religion is the only truth, are ſo ſtrong, that they be of much more force and officacy then the wordes of any Meſſenger in the world. If it pleaſe your Lordſhip to heare the Sermons, you ſhall eaſily ſee the truth of the Chriſtian fayth, and euidently perceaue the falſity of all the Sectes of Iapone.</hi> With this the Gouernour growing into great choler, commanded them imediatly to

He told them he was very ſorry that they being of his name, and ſomething alſo of kinred vnto him, would cauſe him inſteed of fauour to proceed with rigour againſt them. They anſwered, that they, their wiues &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were Chriſtians, and by Godes holy grace would ſo remaine, and that for their holy religion they were ready to giue their liues. Whereupon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour comanded them to keep their owne houſe as a priſon vntill he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with the Prince what ſhould be done. Vpon this it ſeemed vnto them that they were now in great liklihood to obteine the crowne of Martirdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e which they ſo much deſired: the better therfore to prepare themſelues thereto they went one night to <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed themſelues, deſiring the Fathers to pray for them, that for their ſinnes &amp; owne vnworthines they might not looſe their crowne which they expected. The ſame night they returned home againe,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:6796:142"/>made themſelues now apparell, and bought candles to carry in their handes when they ſhould be carried to Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, expecting euery houre with great deſire their iudgment, ſentence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
               <p n="8">8.

His head being cut off they tyed ſtones ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as alſo vnto his holy body, and caſt them both into the ſea, becauſe no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of him ſhould remayne: returning home they confiſcated his goods &amp; houſe making his wife a ſlaue. The ſame they did with the wife children and goods of <hi>Coſmo</hi> his elder brother, whome they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of the country, the which he accepted willingly being no leſſe ioyfull to looſe that which he had for Chriſt, the full of ſorrow that he was not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to his brother in the Crowne of Martyrdome.</p>

               <p>THERE were in <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> as I ſaid in the 5. Chapter, foure Churchs of the Society of Ieſus, three Monaſteries, of <hi>S. Auſtin, S.

               <p n="2">2. At the beginning of this yeare the Biſhop of <hi>Iapone, Don Luis Cerqueira</hi> of the Society of Ieſus departed out of this life. He was a man of great wiſdom and learning, and of no leſſe vertue, piety, &amp; ſanctity of life, &amp; very zealous of the good of his Church, which by his death at that tyme ſuſtayned a wonderous loſſe. Greatly was he grieued to ſee ſo cruell a perſecution rayſed againſt his flocke, and that he could not by any meanes remedy it, nor defend his ſheep
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:6796:145"/>from the cruell wolues. Some monthes before the perſecution did begin he fell ſicke, and after with the newes thereof and griefe ther at his ſickneſſe dayly did increaſe, and ſo within a few dayes no phiſicke being of force to prolonge or ſane his life, he gaue his ſoule vnto Alm. God, vnto whoſe paternall prouidence he did commend his poore afflicted Church, deſiring him eyther to defend and ſuccour it, or els to giue force and ſtrength to the Chriſtians to ſuffer and endure the violent and tyranicall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges of the Gentills their enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. His death was vpon the 16. of February 1614.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sixetene yeares had he gouerned that new planted Church with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude and rare examplar life, and in that tyme he had feene many different ſucceſſes, ſometimes great proſperity in the connerſion of many ſoules and men of worth, vnto the fayth of Chriſt: at other tymes great aduerſicies, afflictions and perſecutions, in all which he alwaies
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:6796:145"/>ſhewed a great quietnes and ſerenity of mind, and a firme truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God. He was much reſpected and beloued of his flock &amp; of all the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons that were in <hi>Iapone:</hi> yea the <hi>Xogun</hi> himſelfe, his Courtiers and Fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites when ſome yeares agoe he did vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit them, did commend and eſteeme him very much; ſo did likewiſe all the Lordes and Princes, though they were otherwiſe as Gentills, not affected to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: for which reaſon at this tyme there was great want of him, and his death was much lamented generally of all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. After his death Father Prouinciall of the Society remayned with the care of the gouernement of the Biſhopricke, vntil ſuch tyme as another Paſtor ſhould be appointed, and for that reſpect, as alſo for the obligation of the common good of all the Chriſtians of <hi>Iapone,</hi> he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with the aduice and counſaile of the reſt of the religious, to ſend vnto the Court Father <hi>Iames Meſquita</hi> of the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:6796:146"/>Society, who had beene a long tyme Rector of the Colledg of <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> &amp; was well acquainted with the <hi>Safioye,</hi> to deale with the <hi>Xogun,</hi> and to giue him information of the truth of all matters. The Father went and did his beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, but the <hi>Safioye</hi> himſelfe being the Chiefe ſticler in the buſines, gaue him anſwere, that it was not poſſible to haue audience in that matter, becauſe the <hi>Xo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun</hi> was already fully reſolued that not ſo much as one of all the Fathers ſhould remayne in all the Country, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he comanded him imediatly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> where all did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelues to the conflict no leſſe then in other places, vſing to that end al ſpirituall meanes they could, now that there was no hope in humane diligence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the Colledge of the Society comonly there were wont to be before this perſecution began foure thouſand Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municants, and more in euery of the principall feaſtes of the yeare: but now there was much greater concourſe both
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:6796:146"/>of thoſe that dwelt within the Citty, as alſo of thoſe that came from abroad and liued in other places. Scarce were there any that did not make in this occaſion a general confeſſion of al their life, thereby to prepare themſelues the better to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome: many both men and women made themſelues new clothes, therein to ſignify the gladnes and willingnes of their mindes to ſuffer death, or any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes for their faith, as alſo to receiue them therein with more decency. To the end that al might be holpen and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſtructed in this occaſion, &amp; this do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e with the leaſt note poſſible, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in euery ſtreet one houſe where the people commonly met togeather to make the prayer of Fortie-howres, ſix or ſeauen Preachers going out of the Colledge euery day thither to make them exhortations, and inſtruct them how they ought to behaue themſelues in the confeſſion of their faith, in their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and in Martyrdome it ſelfe: and in theſe places inumerable were the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:6796:147"/>faſtes, diſciplines, and other pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which were done to that end.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whileſt they were thus buſied &amp; imployed, there came letters from the <hi>Xogun</hi> that all the religious perſons and thoſe that were baniſhed for their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould find ſhips at their owne charges, to go out of the Country the October following, the which newes did increaſe both the griefe, and the feruour of the Chriſtians, who were all diſtributed into diuers Confraternities, thereby the better and with greater vnion to helpe one the other, as indeed by that meanes they did exceedingly. But becauſe it is an eaſy matter through zeale &amp; feruour to grow to ſome, exceſſe therefore the Fathers tooke great care to counſayle them they ſhould behaue themſelues in ſuch ſort, that they did not exaſperate the Gentills, nor giue them occaſion to report, that the cauſe of the perſecution was ſome mutiny or rebellion on their parts, and not only becauſe they would not deny the fayth of Chriſt: and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:6796:147"/>they did procure that certaine writings which they made amongſt themſelues and ſubſcribed with their names, what they would do in caſe that the Fathers were put out of <hi>Iapone,</hi> and themſelues forced to deny their fayth, ſhould be done in that manner that the Gentills ſhould haue no colour to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate them: the which was a matter of very great importance &amp; confequence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The feruour of the Chriſtians increaſing dayly more &amp; more, came at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthto that paſſe that not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with their ſecret penances, they began (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euer conſulting the Fathers therein) to make open proceſſions in the ſtreets, doing therein many publike penances. About the beginning of May they made one or two, all of them diſciplining themſelues therein: and vpon the twelfe day of the ſame moneth there went one out of the Church of <hi>All-Saintes</hi> with diuers kindes of penances in which there were about a thouſand penitentes, ſome carryng heauy croſſes on their backes,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:6796:148"/>others being loaden with chaines of Iron, others fiercely diſciplining of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and the like, in this manner viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the Churches of the towne, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with weeping eyes mercy at God Almighty his handes: and diuers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren went in their company ſinging the letanies with ſuch deuotion, as moued euen the hardeſt harts to melt with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and their eyes to ſheed aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant teares. In this manner they went continuing their proceſſion vntil there were neyther ſtreet nor Confraternity in al the towne that did not make one or two at the leaſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Within the Octaues of Pentecoſt there were made two very ſolemne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions; the firſt was ordered by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>S. Dominickes</hi> Order, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were an exceeding number that did diſcipline themſelues, and diuers with ropes tyed to their neckes and crownes of pricking thornes vpon their heades. The ſecond was directed by the Fathers of <hi>S. Auguflines</hi> Order, in which there
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:6796:148"/>were ſome 500. perſons all clothed in purple weedes carriyng heauy croſſes on their backes, beſides diuers others that went diſciplining of themſelues: ſo that there was not ſcarce any one perſon in all the Citty, man, woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor Child that did not, ſome once, ſome twice, ſome thrice go in theſe proceſſions, doing ſom pennance or other therin, all with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to moue Almighty God to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towardes them, and to ſhew the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they had by this meanes to prepare themſelues to ſuffer ſome thing for the loue of Chriſt. For concluſion of all, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prouinciall of the Society did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point that a ſolemne proceſſion of the bleſſed <hi>Sacrament</hi> ſhould be made in the Colledge vpon <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day, the which was accordingly performed with very great ſolemnity, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>courſe of people and denotion, and after it the prayor of 40. houres was kept publikely, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons made both in the morning and afternoone: wherin the people were ſo moued to deuotion, to ſighes, and
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:6796:149"/>teares, that the Preacher at length could ſcarce be heard for them: all which put many in good hope that God would heare their cryes and prayers, and eyther tye the handes of thoſe that were their enemies, or giue them force and ſtrength to get the victory.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This feruorous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and to ſee moreouer that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians made ſo ſmall account of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thinges, did cauſe ſuch an amaze in the ſeruantes of <hi>Safioye,</hi> who were Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills, that they wrote forthwith vnto their Lord (who was now comming from the Court) ſignifiiyng vnto him that the Citty was all in an vprore, all vnyted together and reſolued not to obey the <hi>Xogun,</hi> nor to let the Fathers depart the country, paynting out the matter in the worſt manner that they could, and aduiſing him he ſhould be carefull and conſider how he came. If theſe letters had come to <hi>Safioye</hi> his owne handes it had beene an eaſy matter to haue infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him of the truth and pacified all:
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:6796:149"/>but the Meſſenger miſſing of him in the way, went directly vnto the Court of <hi>Surunga,</hi> and gaue them to a ſiſter of his who was in great league with the <hi>Xogun,</hi> and ſhe being a wicked woman, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till and an enemy to the Chriſtian fayth, went weeping with them vnto the <hi>Xo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,</hi> and related the matter in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as though doubtleſſe her brethren were both of them ſlaine already at <hi>Nangaſaqui.</hi> Wherewithall the <hi>Xogun</hi> was ſo moued to anger and indignation, that laying his hand vpon his ſword, he ſwore, that if <hi>Nangaſaqui</hi> were neere hand he would go thither himſelfe in perſon, and put it all to ſword and fire. And fearing leaſt <hi>Safioye</hi> alone could not be able to rule the Chriſtians and bring them to due order and obedience, he commanded that <hi>Surungadone</hi> one of the principall Captaines which he had in <hi>Fuſhimi</hi> ſhould go thither with all his ſouldiers, and gathering together all the reſt thereabout that were needful ſhould execute that there which ſhould be

All the Fathers did deſire to remayne had and diſguiſed in <hi>Iapone</hi> to help the Chriſtians and be partakers of their ſufferinges, but it could not be, by reaſon of the ſtrict order that was taken againſt their ſtay,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:6796:153"/>and the extreme difficulty in fynding meanes to keep them ſecret.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſecular Prieſts and the other religious perſons conſulted the matter amongſt themſelues, and as many of them remayned as could conueniently, and Father Prouinciall of the Society did ſend of his ſubiectes with all ſecrecy into diuers places 18. Fathers, and with them nine brethren, and ſome Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtes, who with more ſecurity might viſit the Chriſtians in the Fathers names then they could themſelues.

               <p n="7">7. For all thoſe perſons that were to go into baniſhment, there were but three ſhippes, and thoſe little ones, and very ill prouided. Vpon Saturday being the 25. of October, <hi>Safioye</hi> ſent word,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:6796:154"/>comanding them that vpon the 27. in any caſe they ſhould imbarke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and if thoſe ſhipps were not ready then, they ſhould all go vnto <hi>Fucunda</hi> which is another port towne thereby. They had already taken all the pictures out of the Churches: and after they had comunicated al that were deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the B. Sacrament &amp; conſummated that which did remayne thereof, they made their laſt Sermons vnto the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians whome they were to leaue behind them there, how they ſhould behaue themſelues in the confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their faith encouraging them to conſtancy, with aſſurance that by the grace of God that tempeſt would quietly ceaſe and could not long endure. The bodies of diuers holy Martyrs that had beene buried in their Churches, they tooke vo &amp; ſecretly layd them in diuers places where they might remayne ſecure, and be kept with reuerent reſpect vntill ſome better tyme. The ſame they did with the bodies of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the Fathers and brethren there
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:6796:154"/>buried who had with great cure &amp; zeale laboured in the cultiuating that parcell of Chriſtes vineyard, becauſe they ſhould not be abuſed and profaned by the Gentills, enemies of Chriſts true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Finallie theſe thinges being al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, vpon the 27. of October in the yeare 1614. the Gentills tooke poſſeſſion of all their Churches. The greater part of the religious men, and the reſt that were appointed to baniſhement, were carried to <hi>Fucunda,</hi> and there put in little Cottages of fiſhermen, and kept by Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that watched them both by ſea and lande.

               <p n="8">8. And in this place dyed Father <hi>Iames Meſquita</hi> a man of great vertue wiſdome and induſtry in the conuerſion of the Gentills of that country of <hi>Iapone</hi> where he had liued well nigh fourty yeares.

Meanes was made to <hi>Safioye</hi> that he might be carried into the Citty to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there, but he would not permit it by any meanes, and ſo being carried to a little ſtraw cabbin of a poore Fiſherman there he dyed with wounderous ioy and comfort of his ſoule vpon the firſt day of Nouember, hauing ſuffered in his life tyme very much for the propagation of the fayth, and glory of our bleſſed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Gentills ſoone after they had taken the Chriſtians Churches into
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:6796:155"/>their handes with great contempt began to pull them downe and burne the wood therof, as they had done in <hi>Meaco</hi> and <hi>Ozaca:</hi> but this ioy did not endure long, for that not long after there came newes that the Kingdome was all in an vprore by reaſon of a falling out betwixt the old <hi>Xogun</hi> &amp; <hi>Fideyori</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Taycoſama,</hi> who was laſt Emperour, as ſhall be ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed at the end of the ſecond part of this Relation.</p>

               <p>IT is not hard to coniecture in what affliction the poore Chriſtians of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone</hi> remayned, ſeeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues now without Prieſtes and Paſtours, then Churches caſt downe and burned, and all the Country ſwarming with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:6796:156"/>not knowing what would be the end &amp; euent of ſo tempeſtuous a ſtorme, yet much more was the griefe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were by violence ſeparated from their ſpirituall Children, whome by the Ghoſpell of Chriſt Ieſus they had begotten vnto God, &amp; whome therefore they moſt entirely loued, &amp; whoſe good they moſt earneſtly deſired. This only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted them, that they hoped to returne vnto them ſhortly diſguiſed, if they could not otherwiſe; and alſo to ſee them with ſuch courage to ſuffer for their fayth when they departed from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The two ſhips that went for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> ariued ſafely there within few dayes, as both the way being ſhorter, and the ſhips much better then that which went vnto the <hi>Philipines,</hi> which being but an old veſſell not well prouided, and ſo loaden with paſſengers that they could ſcarce ſtand one by another, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much feared would miſcary by the way. And this feare was much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:6796:157"/>by meanes of two ſhipps of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> which being in <hi>Firando</hi> meant to haue ſet out after them and taken them, the which infallibly they would haue done, had not the Lord of that Citty, though a Gentil, hindred them. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Society did not thinke to haue ſent more then eight or ten vnto the Philippines, and ſcarce had they taken roome for ſo many in the ſhip, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when afterwardes it fell out to be preciſely neceſſary that eight and thirty ſhould go therein, they were ſo ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and peſtered, that therewithall &amp; by reaſon of other incommodities there dyed two of the Fathers, and two of the brethren: two of them whileſt they were at ſea, and the other two imediatly after their comming to land.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Fa. Antony Francis de Critant</hi> was the firſt of them that dyed at ſea, a man of threeſcore and eight years old whereof he had ſpent thirty in <hi>Iapone</hi> with great example of ſanctity, holines of life and zeale of ſoules. He was Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:6796:157"/>of the Colledge of <hi>Nangaſaqui,</hi> and tooke ſuch paines at the tyme of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture thence that with very wearines, and the foreſaid ſtriatnes, without any other infirmity, he dyed: and becauſe he was of notorious vertue, and dyed in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for the fayth of Chriſt, he was reuerenced of all the religious men that went in the ſhip, as a worthy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Chriſt. He dyed within ſight of land, and therefore the Captaine of the ſhip with diuers of the religious perſons carried his body vnto an Hermitage by the ſhore ſide, from whence afterward it was conueyed to the Citty &amp; Colledge of <hi>Manilla,</hi> where within a few dayes they arriued after a monethes nauigation, wherein they had had much foule wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and diuers cruell ſtormes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Before I relate the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of inter, taynment which was made in <hi>Manilla</hi> to <hi>Don Iuſto, Don Iohn</hi> and their Company, it will not be amiſſe to ſhew briefly who they where, and ſet downe ſome part of that which they did and ſuffered
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:6796:158"/>for the fayth of Chriſt, and for his holy Church. This <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> was borne in the Kingdome of <hi>Tzunocuni,</hi> not far off from the Citty of <hi>Meaco:</hi> his Fathers name was <hi>Darius Findadono,</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Mary:</hi> he was of the noble and auncient houſe and linage of <hi>Tacayama</hi> which doth ſignify a High mountayne, and it agreed well vnto them, for both the Father and the Sonne were men of great vertue, excellent example, and ſinguler defenders of all the Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Cami,</hi> a great part of the Country ſo called. <hi>Findadono Don Iuſto</hi> his Father was alwaies held and eſteemed for a very worthy Captaine and exceeding wiſe, much giuen whileſt he was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til to the ſtudy of the <hi>Iapoman</hi> Sectes and ſuperſtitious worſhip of their Idolles, from which he was brought by this meanes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Father <hi>Gaſpar Vilela,</hi> and one <hi>Laurence a</hi> Brother of the Society had preached the Chriſtian fayth in <hi>Meaco,</hi> for the ſpace of ſiue or ſix yeares, with
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:6796:158"/>ſuch oppoſition of the <hi>Bonzi</hi> and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills, that the fruit of their labours was but very ſmall: many tymes they went about to haue killed them, or baniſhed them, holding and reputing them as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous &amp; ignorant perſons, as enomies of the <hi>Caymies</hi> &amp; <hi>Fotoques,</hi> &amp; of the peace and quiet of the Kingdome. At the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bonzi, the examination of their cauſe was committed vnto two Gentlemen very earneſt in the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Gentills, who one day mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to make a mockery of a certaine Chriſtian, aked him certaine queſtions about the Chriſtian fayth. He at the firſt modeſtly excuſed himſelfe alleadging his ignorance, as being no ſcholler, and a ſimple man, but afterwardes he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the beſt he could. They vrged him with difficultyes more and more, and he ſo well behaued himſelfe in anſwering, that their ieſting and mockery turned to good earneſt in the end: for that they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues conuinced with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which he did alledge, deſired him in
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:6796:159"/>any caſe he would bring them a preacher becauſe they meant purpoſely to heareal that could be ſaid. It was feared that this was only a trappe layd the better thereby to take the Father, yet did he ſend Brother <hi>Laurence</hi> aforſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who through the help &amp; grace of God, did ſo worke with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelfe came vnto them as he did ſoone after, he found wolues turned into lambes, and the men wholy changed from that they were before, ſo that after they were inſtructed ſufficiently he did baptize them, and diuers other who were moued by their example, and by that meanes the ſtorme for that tyme did ceaſe, to the great griefe and diſcredit of the Bonzi.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There was great ſpeach in the Court of the ſtrange mutation of theſe two Gentlemen, and <hi>Findadono</hi> among the reſt did vſe to ieſt at them very much, it ſeeming to him an eaſy thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the Brother in fauour of their Sectes. Inquiring therefore where he
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:6796:159"/>was, he went vnto him, heard his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, argued, queſtioned, diſputed with him diuers tymes, but ſuch was the light and euidence of the truth of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique religion, that he found himſelfe (though meruailing at himſelfe) wholly conuinced therewith, and ſo was not only himſelfe baptized, but carrying the Father to his Caſtle of <hi>Saua,</hi> he cauſed him alſo to inſtruct and baptize his wife, Children, and kinred, and ſome 100. Gentlemen of his houſe. He deſired his owne name ſhould be <hi>Darius,</hi> his wifes <hi>Mary,</hi> and his eldeſt ſonne <hi>Iustus</hi> who was then 15. yeares old; this happened the yeare 1565. in which yeare alſo was conuerted and baptized <hi>Don Iohn Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>todono</hi> of fourteene yeares of age, Lord of almoſt all the Kingdome of <hi>Tamba,</hi> a young Gentlemen of great expectation. By <hi>Darius</hi> his meanes and example, he was moued to be a Chriſtian, and was companion then vnto <hi>Don Iuſtus</hi> in baptiſme, as he was now in baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="7">

               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Their ſecond comendation may be, for the great zeale they alwayes ſhewed in defending of the Church, &amp; miniſters thereof in the great combates and contradictions which it had in the beginning thereof. Immediatly almoſt after they were baptized <hi>Miyoridono,</hi> and <hi>Daniedono Don Iohns</hi> vnckle, killed the <hi>Cuboſama,</hi> who was then the Lord of all <hi>Iapone,</hi> the <hi>Bonzi</hi> who were then great with the <hi>Dayri</hi> (who was the true owner of the Empire) tooke that opportunity to get the Fathers baniſhed by publique proclamation from the <hi>Dayri,</hi> conſilca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Houſe and Church, and very hardly letting them paſſe with life. In
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:6796:161"/>this occaſion theſe worthy Gentlemen were the principall defence, and almoſt only refuge the Fathers had in almoſt three yeares that their baniſhment endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And when <hi>Nobunanga</hi> entred <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> by force of armes, <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Don Iusto</hi> by <hi>Vatadono</hi> his meanes who was Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Meaco,</hi> got the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſtored in hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſorte, with ample Patentes from the new <hi>Cuboſama,</hi> and <hi>Nobunanga</hi> to preach the Ghoſpell freely where they pleaſed, in deſpite of all the <hi>Bonzi</hi> and of the <hi>Dayri</hi> himſelfe. And all the tyme that Nobunanga liued, who fauoured <hi>Don Iusto</hi> very much, they were perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall defenders and vpholders of the Fathers in many great and grieuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, rayſed againſt them by the <hi>Bonzi,</hi> expoſing many tymes to danger for their ſakes their eſtates, their honors and their liues.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Exceeding great likewiſe was the zeale they had of the conuerſion of ſoules vnto the Chriſtian fayth. In the tyme <hi>Don Iohn</hi> was Lord of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:6796:161"/>of <hi>Tamba</hi> (for afterwardes he loſt it in the tyme of <hi>Nobunanga</hi> his warrs) he was the cauſe of great good therein in that kind. The Country of <hi>Tucacuqui</hi> whereof <hi>Darius</hi> &amp; <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> were Lords was full of <hi>Bonzi,</hi> hauing many ancient Temples therein, and very much inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a ſort of Gentills that were moſt obſtinate yet ſuch was their zeale, their care and induſtry, that partly by entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, partly by benefittes, partly by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations they moued and perſwaded many to imbrace the Chriſtian fayth; ſo that within few yeares there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not ſo much as one Gentill in all the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, nor any Temple that eyther was not deſtroied, or turned into a Church, nor a <hi>Bonzo</hi> that was not eyther conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or els went willingly away vnto ſome other place. The like they did in another Country that was giuen by <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunanga:</hi> and in <hi>Acaxi</hi> they begon to do the ſame. By which may well be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the exceeding great number of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills, that by their induſtry and meanes
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:6796:162"/>receaued the Chriſtian faith. They buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many Churches in all the townes, ſet vp many croſſes in high wayes and vpon montaines, helping in all thinges the Fathers of the Society that had care there of the conuerſion and inſtruction of the people; and being ſtill the firſt in prayer, pennance, and all other pious workes as Fathers and Mayſters of their ſubiectes, to the great admiration of all the Gentills that liued theraboutes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The ſame pious offices did they likewiſe exerciſe being at the Court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Lords and Noble men. For <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> in particuler being ſo wiſe and prudent, and ſo eſteemed as he was generally of them all, would neuer let occaſion paſſe, but by one meanes or other he would procure to giue notice to them all; of the truth and ſolidity of Chriſtian beliefe, and of the falſhood &amp; errors of their ſectes, and that with ſuch efficacity, that all the moſt principall Chriſtians of the Court were conuerted by his perſwaſion or example, and the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:6796:162"/>Gentills that were the Fathers friends were al gained by his meanes. Inſo much that for diuers yeares the Gentills called the Chriſtian religion the religion of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayama,</hi> not knowing other name for it but this of <hi>Don Iuſto,</hi> who was ſo zealous a profeſſor therof.</p>

And <hi>Don Iusto</hi> his integrity and purity of life was ſo great he being a moſt noble and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious gentleman, in the very flower of his age, and in the middeſt of manifold euill occaſions, that <hi>Taycoſama</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour himſelfe did highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend him for the ſame, not without great wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereat.

               <p n="17">17. The ſecond was in the tyme of <hi>Quambacu</hi> or <hi>Taycoſama.</hi> A certaine Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine called <hi>Aquechi</hi> killed <hi>Nobunanga</hi> in the yeare 1582. and <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> was one of the priucipall that did reuenge his death and brake the army of the enimies, and thereby was a great occaſion that <hi>Quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacu</hi> did ſucceed in the Empire, for which cauſe he was very much eſteemed of him, and the Chriſtians greatly fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that manner, and that he was not held for a man of diſcretion that had not heard the Sermons of the Catechiſme at <hi>Don Iuſtos</hi> perſwaſion. By which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes many noble perſonages were made Chriſtians and baptized. This proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity did endure vntill the yeare 1587. in which <hi>Quambacu</hi> did ſet vpon the conqueſt of the Kingdomes of <hi>Ximo,</hi> in which warres his principall Captaines
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:6796:168"/>were all Chriſtians, <hi>Don Iuſto, Don Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine., Condera, Simeon,</hi> the Lordes of <hi>Bungo, Arima,</hi> and <hi>Omura,</hi> and others: ſo great feruour being in the Campe that all was hearing of Sermons, and making Croſſes in their banners: but all this was turned vpſide downe, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of an old <hi>Bonzo</hi> called <hi>Yacuin</hi> vpon this occaſion.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Quambacu</hi> had giuen vnto <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> the eſtate of <hi>Acaxi,</hi> and the <hi>Bonzi</hi> therof thinking doubtleſſe they ſhould be thereby vtterly vndone, before he came to take poſſeſſion, they all of them went with their Idolls vnto <hi>Quambacu</hi> his mother, to aske mercy and fauour by meanes of this <hi>Yacuin,</hi> who was very great with her, alledging that <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> was a deſtroyer of Idols and Temples, and therefore they intreated ſhe would be a meanes that they, their Temples with their reuenewes might be freed &amp; fauoured. But <hi>Don Iusto</hi> held himſelfe for much abuſed by them, that they would accuſe him in the Court, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:6796:168"/>done no iniury at all vnto them, for which cauſe he would giue no eare vnto them. They departed with many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes againſt him, and <hi>Yacuin</hi> reſted very deſirous to reuenge himſelfe of this which he eſteemed a diſgrace, &amp; of the deſtruction of his Idolls.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Comming therefore from the Country of <hi>Arima,</hi> he complayned vnto <hi>Quambacu,</hi> that the Fathers had perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Arimadono</hi> to take from him certaine Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gentlewomen which he meant to haue brought to him for bad intents and purpoſes. He extolled very much their beauty, comelines of perſon, and the like, proteſting that the Fathers were much more obeyed in that Country then his Highnes, and that it was intolerable that a ſtrange religion ſhould be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to floriſh ſo much within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Iapone,</hi> and that <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> went vp and downe ſolliciting all the could, that the Temples and Idolls might be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroied, the <hi>Bonzi</hi> baniſhed, and the people made Chriſtians by maine
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:6796:169"/>force, alledging alſo what he had ſeene and knowne done in <hi>Tacazuqui, Acaxi Bungo, Arima,</hi> &amp; other partes. <hi>Quambacu</hi> with this complaint was much moued vnto wrath, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the Fathers to be baniſhed, the Churches ouerthrown and that all the Lordes ſhould eyther leaue their Fayth, or looſe their landes, liuinges, and eſtates.</p>
               <p n="20">. The principall Combat was now againſt <hi>Don Iuſto,</hi> to whome ſome friends of his carried the meſſage, and vſed many perſwaſions vnto him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate himſelfe vnto the tyme. He anſwered conſtantly that he was ready to giue his life and liuing for <hi>Quambacu,</hi> but much more for the fayth of Chriſt, and that therefore if they loued him, they ſhould not ſo much as mention any ſuch matter any more. There was none there that durſt carry this anſwere backe to <hi>Quambacu:</hi> whereupon he riſing vp ſaid: I will my ſelfe tell him ſo much vnto his face, and I will carry my ſword alſo with me, that his Maieſty may with
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:6796:169"/>it cut off my head for this cauſe if he pleaſe. Whereupon <hi>Quambacu</hi> comanded that he ſhould be baniſhed, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it with outward ſignes of great internall ioy. This only was a griefe vnto him, to ſee ſo many gallant men as he had attending on him, al vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and reduced to pouerty vpon this occaſion: for it is the cuſtome in <hi>Iapone,</hi> that the Lord or maiſter being baniſhed, all that hould liuinges or landes of him do imediatly loofe them all. But neyther this nor the teares of his friends, nor the perſwaſions of many Princes and Lords could moue him any thing at all. So did he now depart from the Court alone &amp; with diſgrace, where a little before he had entred with great honor and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and liued in great eſteeme and reputation. His parentes, wife, children and kinred left vpon this newes the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe and Eſtate of <hi>Acaxi,</hi> and did retire themſelues vnto a poore village of the mountaine Country, where his Father <hi>Darius</hi> made an holy end of this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:6796:170"/>and mortall life, and he himſelfe went ſecretly to ſeeke the Fathers of the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, who becauſe they would not leaue the Country and Chriſtians deſolate, lay hidden priuately in the Iland of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macaſa,</hi> where when he came he made the ſpirituall Exerciſe with very great deuotion, and therein, a Generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all his life ſince his firſt being a Chriſtian, ioyfull to ſee himſelfe now freed from the world, and greatly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to begin a new religious life. And Almighty God did ſo ordaine, that the Lordes and Nobles of the Court did euen ſtriue among themſelues to receiue &amp; giue intertainement to the Captaines and Gentlemen that had beene his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, who afterward were occaſion of exceeding great good, and of the ſpreading of the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fayth in many Kingdomes.</p>
               <p n="21">. More then a yeare did <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> liue in pouerty and obſcurity, &amp; <hi>Quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacu</hi> then ſeeing that he could not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his conſtancy, nor with honor
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:6796:170"/>reſtore him to his former place and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he commanded the Lord of the Kingdomes of <hi>Canga, Noto,</hi> and <hi>Yetehu,</hi> who had been <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> his equall a ſmal tyme before, that he ſhould keepe him in his Country, and giue him neceſſary allowance for his maintenance. Six and twenty yeares he liued in thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes with an inuincible courage and conſtancy of mind, and rare exemplar life, alwaies prepared to giue his life for Chriſt. And that which deſerueth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration is, that being ſo ſtout of mind and full of mettall as he was, and ſeeing that other perſons that were nothing in reſpect of him did riſe to great eſtates &amp; dignities, and that only becauſe he was a Chriſtian did liue in perpetual diſgrace and continuall danger alſo; yet did he neuer giue ſo much as once a ſigne of any ſadnes, nor euer made complaint thereof, but being euer merry, laughed at the world: although <hi>Figendone</hi> gaue him ſiue and twenty thouſand <hi>Gocus</hi> of rent euery yeare, which do equall almoſt our

For after many intreaties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions to make them leaue their fayth, he confiſcated their landes, houſes and liuinges, commanding them vpon paine of their liues not to go out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that no body ſhould receaue them into their houſes, nor ſell them any meate, nor buy any thing for them: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away alſo their Children from them, comanding and threating to keep them vntill they paid a great ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſo that they were compelled to make

But letting this paſſe: as ſoone as in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilla</hi> notice was giuen of their arriuall, there was a generall ioy in all deſiring to giue them all intertainement poſſible, and in particuler the Gouernour thereof <hi>Don Iohn de Silua,</hi> who had heard much of <hi>Don Iuſto,</hi> ſent a Galley well appointed and therein ſome perſons of account to giue him the welcome, and to offer him all courteſy. The wynd being contrary it was three or foure daies ere they could come to land. When they landed all the great Artillery was ſhot off to welcome them, and all the whole Citty, and the religious perſons thereof went vnto the Sea ſhoare the meet and receiue them, as holy Confeſſors of Chriſt, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panying them vnto the Pallace, where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour and Iudges did imbrace them with all kindnes, congratulating their comming thither, and the courage they had ſhewed in ſuffering ſo much for
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:6796:175"/>their fayth as they had done, offering vnto them both in their owne behalfes and in the kinges, whatſoeuer ſhould be neceſſary or conuenient for them. <hi>Don Iusto</hi> in moſt courteous manner gaue them thankes for the great fauour and honor they had done to them, they being altogether vnworthy thereof, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene ſo happy to giue their liues for Chriſt: and ſo taking their leaues of them, they were accompanied by the Cittizens vnto the Colledg of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Ieſus, paſſing in the way by the great Church, and by the Monaſtery of <hi>S.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Don Iuſto</hi> liued only fourty dayes after his arriuall at <hi>Manilla,</hi> and in that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:6796:175"/>tyme he was often viſited by the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by the Archbiſhop, by the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, and all the principall perſons of the Citty, all of them conceiuing a great loue and affection towardes him, and making no leſſe eſteeme of him then his worthineſſe deſerued. But he taking ſmall delight in any thing of this world, deſired nothing ſo much as a houſe a part, where freed from viſitation and complementes, he might without diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction attend to the chiefe buſines of his ſoule, ſaying he feared very much leaſt God would pay him in this life, for that ſmall ſeruice ſome did imagine he had done him. It ſeemeth that Almighty God did meane to proue this his worthy ſouldier as he did his ſeruant <hi>Iob,</hi> and that he would honor him both in life &amp; death in ſigne of the great crowne he would giue him in heauen, for his great courage and conſtancy in his fayth. For that eyther through the chang of ayre &amp; clymates or differences of meates, or through the incomodities he had endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:6796:176"/>in his baniſhment and nauigation (very contrary both to his nature, yeares, and complexion) he fell ſicke of a continuall feuer, accompanied with a bloudy flux, the which in ſmall tyme brought him to his end.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He knew preſently that this diſeaſe was mortall, and ſo he began to prepare himſelfe for death, and ſayd vnto his Confeſſour: <hi>Father, I perceaue that I growe towardes my end, although I make no ſhew of it, becauſe of not diſcomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my family. I am very well content, and comforted therewithall, it being Gods holy will and pleaſure, eſpecially among ſo many religious perſons, and in ſo Christian a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as this is. I pray you render many thanks in my behalfe vnto the Lord Gouernour, the Archbiſhop, Iudges, Religious men, and al the reſt, for the courteſy, fauour, and honor they haue done me. As for my Wife, Daughter &amp; Grandchildren take no care, for I take none at all: they and I am baniſhed for Chriſtes cauſe. I do much eſteeme the loue they haue alwaies borne me, and that they would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:6796:176"/>me hither; I hope that Almighty God for whoſe ſake they are now in a ſtrang coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, will be a true Father vnto them, and ſo they ſhall haue no want of me.</hi> He made a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> ſuch another as holy <hi>Tobias</hi> did, comending vnto them perſeuerance in their fayth, and obedience vnto the Fathers, and that if any of them did not well, the reſt ſhould aduiſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile them, and tell the Fathers of them: and if they did not obey, they ſhould be depriued of their inheritance, and of the name of his houſe &amp; Family. This done he receaued the holy Sacramentes with great deuotion: and after he was annea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he ſaid often tymes: <hi>I deſire now to go to enioy my Lord and Sauiour,</hi> and ſo he gaue his ſoule vnto his Creator, about midnight vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt of February 1615. In all the tyme of his ſickneſſe although it were very paynfull, he neuer ſhewed the leaſt ſigne of impatience in the world nor any feare at all, nor griefe to leaue his Wife, and Children altogeather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided for, and in a ſtrange country,

               <p n="5">5. Exceeding great was the griefe which generally all did ſhew when this newes of his death was publiſhed, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting on the one ſide the loſſe of ſo worthy a perſon whome they entirely loued, and whoſe example if God had giuen him longer life, might haue beene a potent meanes for the conuerſion of his Country, whenſoeuer he had returned thereunto againe: and on the other ſide comforting themſelues, hauing notice of his holy and happy death, all holding and eſteeming him as a moſt noble and worthy Confeſſour of Chriſt. He was buried in the Church of the Society of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> whoſe Ghoſtly child he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beene. There were preſent at his funeralls al the Magiſtrates of the Citty both Eccleſiaſticall and ſecular; all the religious men &amp; the whole Citty, many kiſſing his handes in ſigne of great reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and reuerence. At the taking of his body out of the houſe where it lay, there
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:6796:177"/>aroſe a pyous contention who ſhould carry his Coffin, euery one being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to do that office, thereby to honor him. At length it was agreed, that the Lord Gouernour &amp; Iudges ſhould carry it vnto the ſtreet that then the Citty togeather with the Confraternity of the <hi>Miſericordia</hi> (whereof he was a Brother) ſhould from thence carry it vnto the Church, and that there the Superiors of the religious Orders ſhould take it &amp; conuey it to the place where it was to remaine, during the tyme of the office of the dead.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Cleargy of the Cathedrall Church did celebrate the office both this day, and the day of his ſolemne funerall with great deuotion: the like was done by the religious of the holy orders of <hi>S. Dominicke,</hi> and <hi>S. Francis</hi> in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, and by the Fathers of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines</hi> Order in the Colledge of the Society, they bringing thither to that end ſuch coſtly ornamentes, and doing all in that fuſhion, as might well haue
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:6796:178"/>beſeemed the funeralls of a King. Vpon the nynth day after his death all that had beene preſent at his buriall returned to his funeralls, wherein after the holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſſe ended was preached a notable ſermon of the heroical vertues of <hi>Don Iuſto,</hi> whoſe Exequies they then ſolemnized, to the great comfort and edification of all there preſent, but more in particuler of the <hi>Iaponians,</hi> whereof there were in <hi>Manilla</hi> more then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perſons at that tyme, who much reioyced to ſee thoſe ſo honoured in a ſtrange country, who for the fayth of Chriſt were ſo afflicted and perſecuted in their owne.</p>
